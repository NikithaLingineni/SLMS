40130009,Urinary based biomarkers identification and genetic profiling in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review of metabolomic studies.,"Parkinson's disease is a complex, age-related, neurodegenerative disease associated with dopamine deficiency and both motor and nonmotor deficits. Therapeutic pathways remain challenging in Parkinson's disease due to the low accuracy of early diagnosis, the difficulty in monitoring disease progression, and the limited availability of treatment options. Few data are present to identify urinary biomarkers for various ailments, potentially aiding in the diagnosis and tracking of illness progression in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Thus, the analysis of urinary metabolomic biomarkers (UMB) for early and mid-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) is the main goal of this systematic review. For this study, six electronic databases were searched for articles published up to 23 February 2024: PubMed, Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct, and Cochrane. 5,377 articles were found and 40 articles were screened as per the eligibility criteria. Out of these, 7 controlled studies were selected for this review. Genetic profiling for gene function and biomarker interactions between urinary biomarkers was conducted using the STRING and Cytoscape database. A total of 40 metabolites were identified to be related to the early and mid-stage of the disease pathology out of which three metabolites, acetyl phenylalanine (a subtype of phenylalanine), tyrosine and kynurenine were common and most significant in three studies. These metabolites cause impaired dopamine synthesis along with mitochondrial disturbances and brain energy metabolic disturbances which are considered responsible for neurodegenerative disorders. Furoglycine, Cortisol, Hydroxyphenylacetic acid, Glycine, Tiglyglycine, Aminobutyric acid, Hydroxyprogesterone, Phenylacetylglutamine, and Dihydrocortisol were also found commonly dysregulated in two of the total 7 studies. 158 genes were found which are responsible for the occurrence of PD and metabolic regulation of the corresponding biomarkers from our study. The current review identified acetyl phenylalanine (a subtype of phenylalanine), tyrosine and kynurenine as potential urinary metabolomic biomarkers for diagnosing PD and identifying disease progression.",1
40129904,Visual processing capacity and cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by motor symptoms. However, approximately half of patients with PD exhibit signs of dementia within a decade of diagnosis. While deficits in working memory and visuospatial abilities are recognised as hallmarks of cognitive decline in PD, these populations are rarely studied using detailed cognitive tools that link cognitive impairments to formal theoretical models, such as the theory of visual attention (TVA). This cross-sectional study addresses this gap by employing the TVA whole report paradigm to assess visual processing in a cohort of patients with PD, both with and without cognitive impairment. Participants were divided based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores into two PD groups (n=25 each) and a healthy control group (n=25). Our principal finding is that the visual processing speed (C) and visual short-term memory capacity (K) are significantly diminished in patients with PD with MoCA scores below 26 (Analysis of variance, p=0.016 for C and p<0.001 for K), while no notable differences were observed between controls and patients with PD with MoCA scores of 26 or above. Using a generalised linear model to assess the impact of factors such as age, gender and disease duration, we discovered that the C-parameter was significantly influenced by age, while the K TVA parameters demonstrate their suitability for detecting cognitive deficits in PD. Given their independence from motor and non-motor symptoms, TVA parameters may prove to be valuable tools for early diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of cognitive deficits in individual patients with PD.",1
40129103,"Tremor in Pediatric Populations: Clinical Characteristics, Differential Diagnosis, and Management Challenges.","Tremor is a hyperkinetic movement disorder defined as a rhythmic, involuntary, oscillatory movement of a body part. It can present as early as in the neonatal period and may be an isolated finding or part of an associated neurological or systemic disorder. Although it is commonly seen in childhood, it is not frequently described in the literature. This review aims to provide a clinically useful overview of pediatric tremors based on the current literature. We identified relevant studies published in English by searching PubMed (until February 2024), using the following subject headings: pediatric/tremor, deep brain stimulation, and focused ultrasound. Data from 65 articles were critically reviewed with focus on tremor classification, etiologies, clinical features, and management. Some tremor disorders in children can persist into adulthood, however, others are exclusively seen in the pediatric population. The lack of epidemiological and clinical studies in the pediatric population creates substantial challenges for pediatricians, and medical decisions are mostly guided by adult data.",1
40128529,"Speech and language biomarkers for Parkinson's disease prediction, early diagnosis and progression.","Parkinson's disease (PD), a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder, can manifest as an array of motor and non-motor symptoms. Among these, speech and language impairments are particularly prevalent, often preceding motor dysfunctions. Emerging research indicates that these impairments may serve as early disease indicators. In this narrative review, we synthesised current findings on the potential of speech and language symptoms in PD identification and progression monitoring. Our review highlights convergent, albeit preliminary, lines of evidence supporting the value of speech-related features in detecting early or prodromal PD, even across language groups, especially with sophisticated analytical techniques. Distinct speech patterns in PD subtypes and other neurological disorders may assist in differential diagnosis and inform targeted management efforts. These features also evolve over the disease course and could effectively be utilised for disease tracking and guide management plan modifications. Advances in digital voice processing allow cost-effective, remote and scalable monitoring for larger populations.",1
40125241,Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: A Systematic Review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents challenges in early diagnosis, particularly in its prodromal stages. PD is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, and it remains challenging to diagnose in its early stages. The use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers has shown promise as an adjunctive tool for early detection and monitoring of disease progression. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of CSF biomarkers in PD. We focused on assessing the reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and utility of various CSF biomarkers for the early and accurate diagnosis of PD. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify relevant studies published from January 2015 to November 2024. Studies were included if they examined CSF biomarkers in human PD patients, and compared to healthy controls or other neurodegenerative diseases. Data on sample size, biomarker types, and diagnostic accuracy were extracted from 34 eligible studies. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using standard tools, and a qualitative synthesis was performed using PRISMA tools. Analysis was done to assess the diagnostic performance of selected biomarkers. The review identified several promising CSF biomarkers, including α-synuclein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), DJ-1, tau, and exosomal biomarkers. Of these, α-synuclein demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy with a sensitivity of 70-85% and specificity of 75-90%. NfL also showed a strong sensitivity (65-85%) for detecting neuronal injury, while DJ-1 exhibited a high specificity for early-stage PD. Multi-biomarker panels, including combinations of α-synuclein, tau, and NfL, demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy compared to individual biomarkers. The variability in the biomarkers' performance was noted across studies, indicating the need for standardization in biomarker assays and further validation through larger, multicenter studies. CSF biomarkers hold significant promise for improving the diagnosis of PD, particularly when used in combination. However, more research is needed to establish standardized protocols and evaluate their role in clinical practice. Multi-biomarker panels show potential as a diagnostic tool, but further investigation is required to confirm their clinical utility and cost-effectiveness in diverse populations. Future studies should focus on the longitudinal tracking of these biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response.",1
40125225,Cortical Ribboning as a Key MRI Finding in Wernicke's Encephalopathy With Altered Mental Status.,"Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency and may lead to mental status changes, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. While treatment is simple, delayed diagnosis can have serious consequences, making early detection essential. However, the complete triad of symptoms is rarely seen. When mental status changes occur, physical examination may be limited, making WE harder to identify without other characteristic signs. Furthermore, measuring blood thiamine levels is not always immediately possible, adding to the challenge of diagnosis. We encountered a case of WE presenting with mental status changes, where cortical ribboning appeared as a significant MRI finding. A 77-year-old male had experienced slowness of movement for approximately one year and was diagnosed with multiple system atrophy (MSA). He had difficulty eating; thus, he preferred soft rice porridge. He developed acute mental status changes, and a brain MRI revealed prominent cortical ribboning in both frontal cortices along with subtle medial thalami. The patient received intravenous thiamine, leading to dramatic recovery of mental status, and subsequent MRI follow-up showed near-complete resolution of both cortical and thalamic lesions. Cortical ribboning, which played a key role in this patient, is recognized as an atypical MRI finding of thiamine deficiency and is suggested to be associated with altered mental status in WE. However, to the best of our knowledge, no literature clearly lists thiamine deficiency as a differential diagnosis for cortical ribboning in patients with mental status changes. Recognizing this key imaging finding is crucial in differentiating WE in patients with mental status changes. Preventing the potentially fatal outcome of WE is of paramount importance. Patients with dysphagia tend to prefer soft foods, which may result in reduced thiamine intake. Our experience reaffirms the importance of a well-balanced diet in MSA patients with dysphagia.",1
40124351,The role of nuclear medicine in neurodegenerative diseases: a narrative review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lewy body dementia, are associated with the accumulation of brain proteins, leading to neuroinflammation, disruption of cellular clearance mechanisms, and neuronal death. Nuclear medicine, utilizing technologies like PET and SPECT, plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing these disorders. Recent advancements in nuclear medicine have enhanced the understanding of disease pathophysiology and facilitated the development of tailored therapeutics. This study aims to address gaps in understanding nuclear medicine's potential to improve early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate therapeutic effectiveness. In this review, we analyzed 28 papers and summarized their findings. PET radioligands have revolutionized the in vivo measurement of pathological targets in neurological diseases, offering new insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative conditions. Amyloid PET has emerged as a reliable diagnostic imaging tool, accurately identifying cerebral amyloid-beta accumulation and enabling early differential diagnosis in clinical settings. Furthermore, radiopharmaceuticals such as [18F]Flortaucipir, [18F]FDOPA, and TSPO ligands provide significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",1
40122396,Fluid-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are increasingly prevalent as global populations age. Fluid biomarkers, derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, saliva, urine, and exosomes, offer a promising solution for early diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. These biomarkers can reflect critical pathological processes like amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, α-syn misfolding, TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation, and neuronal damage, enabling detection long before clinical symptoms emerge. Recent advances in blood-based biomarkers, particularly plasma Aβ, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43, have shown diagnostic accuracy equivalent to CSF biomarkers, offering more accessible testing options. This review discusses the current challenges in fluid biomarker research, including variability, standardization, and sensitivity issues, and explores how combining multiple biomarkers with clinical symptoms improves diagnostic reliability. Ethical considerations, future directions involving extracellular vehicles (EVs), and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are also highlighted. Continued research efforts will be key to overcoming these obstacles, enabling fluid biomarkers to become crucial tools in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative diseases.",1
40120712,Transforming neurodegenerative disorder care with machine learning: Strategies and applications.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), characterized by progressive neuronal degeneration and manifesting in diverse forms such as memory loss and movement disorders, pose significant challenges due to their complex molecular mechanisms and heterogeneous patient presentations. Diagnosis often relies heavily on clinical assessments and neuroimaging, with definitive confirmation frequently requiring post-mortem autopsy. However, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) offers a transformative potential. These technologies can enable the development of non-invasive tools for early diagnosis, biomarker identification, personalized treatment strategies, patient subtyping and stratification, and disease risk prediction. This review aims to provide a starting point for researchers, both with and without clinical backgrounds, who are interested in applying ML to NDs. We will discuss available data resources for key diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, explore how ML can revolutionize neurodegenerative care, and emphasize the importance of integrating multiple high-dimensional data sources to gain deeper insights and inform effective therapeutic strategies.",1
40120616,"Safety and efficacy of long-term gantenerumab treatment in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease: an open-label extension of the phase 2/3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled platform DIAN-TU trial.","Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer's disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure  Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p<0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

40118944,Explaining facial action units' correlation with hypomimia and clinical scores in Parkinson's disease.,"This study aimed to identify facial regions characterizing hypomimia through facial action units (AU). It included video recordings from 109 early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) and 45 healthy control (HC) subjects, performing rapid syllable repetitions. We identified the features contributing most to hypomimia by interpreting an XGBoost model classifying PD vs. HC. We evaluated the impact of biological sex and time on features and classification, and the correlation between model's predictions, AUs, and PD clinical scores over different times. The most discriminant AUs of hypomimia were found on the face lower part, independent of sex, and stable over time. Significant correlations were observed between AU17 (chin raiser) and rigidity of the upper left limb (r = - 0.4), as well as between AU9 (nose wrinkle) and neck rigidity (r = - 0.36). Correlations between XGBoost predictions and MDS-UPDRS3 and neck rigidity scores were also significant (r = 0.3). We obtained for PD detection an AUC of 79.8% and a balanced accuracy of 71.5%.",1
40117607,Dermatological Manifestations and Sebum Composition in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder known for its hallmark motor symptoms. However, nonmotor manifestations, specifically dermatological changes, precede motor symptoms and may thus serve as vital early indicators of PD. This article explores the skin-related changes associated with PD, focusing on alterations in sebum composition, microbial dysbiosis, and the potential for leveraging dermatological assessments as early, noninvasive diagnostic markers for PD. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate dermatological manifestations of PD, focusing on sebum changes in affected individuals. Research explored the clinical relevance of altered lipid profiles, volatile organic compound (VOC) contributions, and microbiome dysbiosis in those with PD. Individuals with PD exhibit excess sebum production characterized by altered lipid profiles, including elevated short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and disruptions in sphingolipid metabolism. The lipid-rich environment also promotes overgrowth of Malessezia yeast, contributing to varied dermatological symptoms in those with PD. VOCs identified in sebum have been linked to unique odors and serve as biomarkers for diagnostic potential. These findings support the potential for early PD diagnosis through dermatologic assessment and sebum analysis. Dermatological manifestations in PD offer promising noninvasive biomarkers for early diagnosis. Future research should aim to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying sebum dysregulation in PD and validate the clinical relevance of these biomarkers in larger populations.",1
40114198,A reciprocal relationship between markers of genomic DNA damage and alpha-synuclein pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"DNA damage and DNA damage repair (DDR) dysfunction are insults with broad implications for cellular physiology and have been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. Alpha-synuclein (aSyn), a pre-synaptic and nuclear protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies, has been associated with DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. However, although nuclear aSyn pathology has been observed in cortical tissue of dementia with Lewy body (DLB) cases, whether such nuclear pathology coincides with the occurrence of DNA damage has not previously been investigated. Moreover, the specific types of DNA damage elevated in DLB cases and the contribution of DNA damage towards Lewy body (LB) formation is unknown. DNA damage and aSyn pathology were assessed in fixed lateral temporal cortex from clinically and neuropathologically confirmed DLB cases and controls, as well as in cortical tissue from young 3-month-old presymptomatic A30P-aSyn mice. Frozen lateral temporal cortex from DLB and control cases was subject to nuclear isolation, western blotting, aSyn seed amplification and proteomic characterisation via mass spectrometry. We detected seed-competent nuclear aSyn, and elevated nuclear serine-129 phosphorylation in DLB temporal cortex, alongside the accumulation of DSBs in neuronal and non-neuronal cellular populations. DNA damage was also present in cortical tissue from presymptomatic A30P mice, demonstrating it is an early insult closely associated with pathogenic aSyn. Strikingly, in postmortem DLB tissue, markers of genomic DNA damage-derived cytoplasmic DNA (CytoDNA) were evident within the majority of LBs examined. The observed cellular pathology was consistent with nuclear upregulation of associated DDR proteins, particularly those involved in base excision repair and DSB repair pathways. Collectively our study demonstrates the accumulation of seed-competent pathological nuclear associated aSyn, alongside nuclear DNA damage and the potential involvement of DNA damage derived cytoDNA species in cytoplasmic aSyn pathology. Ultimately, our study supports the hypothesis of a reciprocal relationship between aSyn pathology and nuclear DNA damage and highlights a potential underlying role for DNA damage in pathological mechanisms relevant to DLB, as well as other synucleinopathies, opening novel possibilities for diagnosis and treatment.",1
40114135,Value of blood biomarkers in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease: a case-control study from Xinjiang.,"Based on the data of Parkinson's disease patients in Xinjiang, China, to explore the clinical application value of blood biomarkers in diagnosing Parkinson's disease patients. The research subjects were patients with Parkinson's disease who were diagnosed and hospitalized at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between January 2021 and January 2023 and those who underwent health check-ups at the hospital, 243 and 249 cases were included, respectively, and those who underwent health check-ups were used as a healthy control group of the Parkinson's disease patient group. Significant differences in age, systolic blood pressure, cystatin C, and uric acid distributions were found between healthy controls and Parkinson's patients (P < 0.05), and multivariate analysis showed that there was a correlation between body mass index, uric acid, and Parkinson's disease (P < 0.05), and that those who were overweight or obese, and those who had a low level of uric acid, had a greater probability of suffering from Parkinson's disease (B > 0). There were significant differences in gender, cystatin C, and urea between Parkinson's patients with a disease duration of < 5 years and those with a disease duration of ≥ 5 years (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, there was a correlation between gender and duration of Parkinson's disease (P < 0.05), and the duration of the disease was greater in male patients than in females. Uric acid combined with body mass index is informative for early screening of Parkinson's disease.",1
40113192,Basal ganglia connectivity and network asymmetry in Parkinson's disease: A resting-state fMRI study.,"This study investigates the impact of basal ganglia network asymmetry on motor function in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), functional connectivity and network asymmetry were analyzed in 15 non-demented PD patients and 15 healthy controls. Sixteen basal ganglia substructures, including the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, were selected for a unified analysis of variance framework to evaluate inter-hemispheric connectivity differences. After spatial preprocessing, regions of interest were defined, and time-series data were extracted for functional connectivity and network asymmetry analysis. The results revealed significant alterations in the functional connectivity of the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in PD patients. Notably, the absence of intra-network asymmetry in the left NAc and bilateral amygdala correlated with motor dysfunction, likely due to overactivity of the inhibitory indirect pathway. Furthermore, pronounced asymmetry in the left putamen and right frontal gyrus suggested a compensatory neural mechanism supporting motor performance. These findings highlight the critical role of basal ganglia network asymmetry in the pathophysiology of PD. The identified asymmetry characteristics may serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease progression monitoring, offering new directions for targeted therapeutic interventions.",1
40107026,Neuro_DeFused-Net: A novel multi-scale 2DCNN architecture assisted diagnostic model for Parkinson's disease diagnosis using deep feature-level fusion of multi-site multi-modality neuroimaging data.,"Neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson's Disease (PD), are serious and progressive conditions that significantly impact patients' motor functions and overall quality of life. Accurate and timely diagnosis is still crucial, but it is quite challenging. Understanding the changes in the brain linked to PD requires using neuroimaging modalities like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) methods, can potentially improve the precision of diagnosis. In the current study, we present a novel approach that integrates T1-weighted structural MRI and rest-state functional MRI using multi-site-cum-multi-modality neuroimaging data. To maximize the richness of the data, our approach integrates deep feature-level fusion across these modalities. We proposed a custom multi-scale 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that captures features at different spatial scales, enhancing the model's capacity to learn PD-related complex patterns. With an accuracy of 97.12 %, sensitivity of 97.26 %, F1-Score of 97.63 %, Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.99, mean average precision (mAP) of 99.53 %, and Dice Coefficient of 0.97, the proposed Neuro_DeFused-Net diagnostic model performs exceptionally well. These results highlight the model's robust ability to distinguish PD patients from Controls (Normal), even across a variety of datasets and neuroimaging modalities. Our findings demonstrate the transformational ability of AI-driven models to facilitate the early diagnosis of PD. The proposed Neuro_DeFused-Net model enables the rapid detection of health markers through fast analysis of complicated neuroimaging data. Thus, timely intervention and individualized treatment strategies lead to improved patient outcomes and quality of life.",1
40105512,Conjunctival impression cytology and tear film analysis in early-stage Parkinson's disease.,"PurposeWe aimed to evaluate conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) findings, tear parameters, and ocular surface in early-stage Parkinson's patients and compare the results with the control group.MethodsThis cross-sectional comparative study included 49 early-stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients and 45 healthy individuals as a control group. Clinical staging of Parkinson's patients was performed according to the Hoehn-Yahr Scale. Those with stages 1 and 2 were defined as early-stage PD.

40102162,Comparison of Voice Quality in Persian Parkinson Patients With Healthy Counterparts Using Cepstral Peak Prominence and Cepstral Peak Prominence-Smooth and Their Relationship With Disease Severity (UPDRS-III) and Disease Duration.,"One of the earliest impairments in Parkinson's patients is speech motor dysfunction, which adversely affects the phonation subsystem (voice). To date, acoustic frequency-dependent voice features such as cepstral peak prominence (CPP) and cepstral peak prominence-smooth (CPPS) have not been examined in Persian-speaking Parkinson's patients. This study aims to compare the voice quality of Persian Parkinson's patients with healthy counterparts using CPP and CPPS, as well as to investigate the relationship of these metrics with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Part III (UPDRS-III) and disease duration. This study included 35 Persian Parkinson's patients and 35 healthy individuals. Disease severity was assessed using UPDRS-III. Speech samples (sustained vowel phonation of /ɑ/ and reading of the ""Grandfather Passage"") were recorded by a microphone. CPP and CPPS were extracted by Praat software. The results showed that the mean CPP and CPPS in both tasks were significantly lower in the patient group compared with the healthy group (P value ≤ 0.001). Spearman correlation analysis of CPP and CPPS values in both tasks with disease severity revealed a significant negative correlation between CPP and CPPS and UPDRS-III in both tasks (P value ≤ 0.001). However, no significant correlation was observed between these indices and disease duration in any task (P value ≥ 0.001). These cepstral indices effectively distinguish vocal differences between Persian Parkinson's patients and healthy individuals. Additionally, these indices show a significant association with disease severity, underscoring their potential utility in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease progression through vocal screening, especially when combined with other medical and neurological evaluations. However, this study found no relationship between disease duration and these indices. The absence of such a correlation may be attributed to the medication regimens of the patients.",1
40101537,Interoception in Parkinson's disease: A narrative review and framework for translational research.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common, and the fastest growing, neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Non-motor manifestations, particularly autonomic nervous system dysfunction, are common throughout the disease course, in some cases preceding motor symptom onset by years, and are often more disabling and harder to treat than motor symptoms and contribute significantly to disability. An understudied consequence of autonomic and visceral dysfunction in PD is interoception, the neural processing of internal organ system signals. Interoceptive processes form a foundational body-brain interface, mediating basic homeostatic reflexes and complex physiologic and behavioral adaptive responses to internal perturbations. Emerging evidence exists that interoception is impaired in some individuals with PD, potentially explaining why those who have objective evidence of autonomic dysfunction do not always report typical symptoms. Failure to recognize these impairments may lead to missed opportunities for early intervention, particularly in addressing 'silent' autonomic disturbances (e.g., orthostatic hypotension leading to sudden falls, dysphagia leading to aspiration pneumonia). In this narrative review, we synthesize current findings on the neuroanatomical networks underlying interoception, examine clinical manifestations of interoceptive dysfunction across multiple organ systems in PD, and identify key gaps in knowledge. We propose a translational research framework to enhance early detection, symptom management, and intervention strategies for PD. This framework integrates cognitive, mood, and autonomic dysfunctions with clinical factors (disease stage, duration, motor subtype, levodopa status) to understand interoceptive dysfunction within a translational model. This approach highlights novel opportunities for personalized care and improved therapeutic interventions in PD.",1
40100196,Expert-Level Automated Diagnosis of the Pediatric ECG Using a Deep Neural Network.,"Disparate access to expert pediatric cardiologist care and interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) persists worldwide. Artificial intelligence-enhanced ECG (AI-ECG) has shown promise for automated diagnosis of ECGs in adults but has yet to be explored in the pediatric setting. This study sought to determine whether an AI-ECG model can accurately perform automated diagnosis of pediatric ECGs. This retrospective single-center cohort study included all patients with an ECG at Boston Children's Hospital read by an experienced pediatric cardiologist (≥5,000 reads) between 2000 and 2022. A convolutional neural network was trained (75% of patients) and internally tested (25% of patients) on ECGs to predict ECG diagnoses. The primary outcome was a composite of any ECG abnormality (ie, detecting normal vs abnormal ECG). Secondary outcomes include Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) and prolonged QTc. Model performance was assessed with area under the receiver-operating (AUROC) and precision recall (AUPRC) curves. The main cohort consisted of 201,620 patients (49% male; 11% with known congenital heart disease) and 583,134 ECGs (median age 11.7 years [Q1-Q3: 3.1-16.9 years]; 56% any ECG abnormality, 1.0% WPW, and 5.3% with prolonged QTc). The AI-ECG model outperformed the commercial software interpretations for detecting any abnormality (AUROC 0.94; AUPRC 0.96), WPW (AUROC 0.99; AUPRC 0.88), and prolonged QTc (AUROC 0.96; AUPRC 0.63). During readjudication of ECGs with AI-ECG/original cardiologist read discordance, blinded expert readers were more likely to agree with AI-ECG classification than the original reader to detect any abnormality (P = 0.001), WPW (P = 0.01), and prolonged QTc (P = 0.07). Our model provides expert-level automated diagnosis of the pediatric 12-lead ECG, which may improve access to care.",1
40095345,Exosomes as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Agents in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Insights and Future Directions.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS rank among the most challenging global health issues, marked by substantial obstacles in early diagnosis and effective treatment. Current diagnostic techniques frequently demonstrate inadequate sensitivity and specificity, whilst conventional treatment strategies encounter challenges related to restricted bioavailability and insufficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Recently, exosomes-nanoscale vesicles packed with proteins, RNAs, and lipids-have emerged as promising agents with the potential to reshape diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to these diseases. Unlike conventional drug carriers, they naturally traverse the BBB and can deliver bioactive molecules to affected neural cells. Their molecular cargo can influence cell signaling, reduce neuroinflammation, and potentially slow neurodegenerative progression. Moreover, exosomes serve as non-invasive biomarkers, enabling early and precise diagnosis while allowing real-time disease monitoring. Additionally, engineered exosomes, loaded with therapeutic molecules, enhance this capability by targeting diseased neurons and overcoming conventional treatment barriers.

40092968,A review of machine learning and deep learning for Parkinson's disease detection.,"Millions of people worldwide suffer from Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia, and stiffness. Accurate early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment. This article presents a novel review of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for PD detection and progression monitoring, offering new perspectives by integrating diverse data sources. We examine the public datasets recently used in studies, including audio recordings, gait analysis, and medical imaging. We discuss the preprocessing methods applied, the state-of-the-art models utilized, and their performance. Our evaluation included different algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), convolutional neural networks (CNN). These algorithms have shown promising results in PD diagnosis with accuracy rates exceeding 99% in some studies combining data sources. Our analysis particularly showcases the effectiveness of audio analysis in early symptom detection and gait analysis, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), in monitoring disease progression. Medical imaging, enhanced by DL techniques, has improved the identification of PD. The application of ML and DL in PD research offers significant potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. However, challenges like the need for large and diverse datasets, data privacy concerns, and data quality in healthcare remain. Additionally, developing explainable AI is crucial to ensure that clinicians can trust and understand ML and DL models. Our review highlights these key challenges that must be addressed to enhance the robustness and applicability of AI models in PD diagnosis, setting the groundwork for future research to overcome these obstacles.",1
40091087,Multinomial logistic regression algorithm for the classification of patients with parkinsonisms.,"Accurate differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonisms is challenging due to overlapping early symptoms and high rates of misdiagnosis. To improve the diagnostic accuracy, we developed an integrated classification algorithm using multinomial logistic regression and Scaled Subprofile Model/Principal Component Analysis (SSM/PCA) applied to  The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were the highest for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (AUC = 0.95), followed by Parkinson's disease (PD) (AUC = 0.93) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (AUC = 0.90). When classifying the patients based on their calculated probability for each group, the desired tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity had to be selected. With a 99% probability threshold for classification into a disease group, 82% of PD patients, 29% of MSA patients, and 77% of PSP patients were correctly identified. Only 5% of PD, 6% of MSA and 6% of PSP patients were misclassified, whereas the remaining patients (13% of PD, 65% of MSA and 18% of PSP) are undetermined by our classification algorithm. Compared to existing algorithms, this approach offers comparable accuracy and reliability in diagnosing PD, MSA, and PSP with no need of healthy control images. It can also distinguish between multiple types of parkinsonisms simultaneously and offers the flexibility to easily accommodate new groups.",1
40090470,Early detection of Parkinson's disease: Retinal functional impairments as potential biomarkers.,"Parkinson's disease is typically diagnosed after substantial neurodegeneration despite early non-motor symptoms manifesting decades earlier. These changes offer a promising avenue for diagnostic exploration, especially within the eye, which has been proposed as a ""window to the brain."" The aim was to identify biomarkers by validating the use of electroretinography, a non-invasive technique, to detect early retinal function anomalies reflecting central dysfunction. Homozygous M83 transgenic mice (n = 10 males, 11 females), overexpressing human A53T α-synuclein, underwent behavioral tests and electroretinography measurements. Histological evaluation was performed at four months to analyze synucleinopathies and neurodegeneration. Electroretinography was also conducted with idiopathic PD patients (mean age 63.35 ± 7.73; disease duration 4.15 ± 2.06; H&Y score 2.07 ± 0.59; n = 12 males, 8 females) and healthy age-matched controls (mean age 61.65 ± 8.39; n = 9 males, 11 females). Rodent electroretinography revealed reduced photopic b-wave, PhNR b-wave, and PhNR-wave amplitudes at two and four months, particularly in females, indicating bipolar and retinal ganglion cell impairment. Based on retinal histological assessment, these changes might arise from α-synuclein pathology occurring in outer retinal layers. Likewise, the scotopic b-wave and PhNR waveform were similarly impaired in female participants with Parkinson's disease. The scotopic oscillatory potentials isolated further identified an attenuated amacrine cell output in females. Findings from both mice and human cohorts indicate that retinal functional impairments can be detected early in the progression of Parkinson's disease, particularly among females. These tools show promise in facilitating early diagnosis, disease monitoring, therapeutic intervention, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.",1
40088779,"Early-onset Parkinson's disease, regional and national burden, and its attributable risk factors in 204 countries and regions from 1990 to 2021: Results from the global burden of disease study 2021.","Early-Onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD), defined as diagnosis before age 40, accounts for 5-10 % of Parkinson's cases and is characterized by slower progression and severe motor and non-motor complications. Its global burden has risen significantly, particularly among younger populations, but comprehensive analyses of trends, disparities, and determinants remain scarce. EOPD burden was examined in 204 countries from 1990 to 2021 using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data. Age-standardized rates (ASR) for incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were computed. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was used to analyze temporal trends. Associations with the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) were investigated, and projections were made for future trends up to 2035 using time-series models. Global ASRs for incidence, mortality, and DALYs in 2021 were 0.333, 0.006, and 0.461 per 100,000 population, respectively. Incidence and DALYs increased from 1990 to 2021, while mortality fluctuated. Higher burdens were reported in high-SDI regions due to improved detection and longer survival, whereas low-SDI regions faced underdiagnosis and limited healthcare access. Projections suggest a continued rise in EOPD burden, particularly in the 35-39 age group, by 2035. The increasing worldwide burden of EOPD, along with significant regional and socioeconomic inequalities, underscores the pressing necessity for prompt diagnosis, equitable healthcare access, and specific interventions to address this escalating public health issue.",1
40088380,DNA Methylation-Regulated ZDHHC13 Promotes the Progression of Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent studies suggest that palmitoylation may influence proteins involved in neurotransmission and neurodegenerative changes, such as pathological α-synuclein. However, the role of palmitoylation in Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been systematically investigated. Additionally, findings on DNA methylation changes and PD-associated gene expression remain inconsistent. This study aims to explore the causal relationship and mechanisms between palmitoylation genes, DNA methylation, and PD using Mendelian Randomization (MR). This study employed two-sample MR analysis, summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis, and mediation analysis, utilizing PD GWAS data from the Finngen database, palmitoylation genes data from the eQTLGen database, and DNA methylation data from the GoDMC database. First, a two-sample MR analysis was used to evaluate the causal relationship between the palmitoylation genes and PD. Then, the SMR method was applied to validate the association between gene expression and PD. Finally, mediation analysis was conducted to explore the mediating effect of DNA methylation on the relationship between expression of palmitoylation genes and PD. Our study found a significant positive correlation between high expression of the ZDHHC13 gene and increased PD risk. Each 1 standard deviation increase in ZDHHC13 expression was associated with a 24.20% increase in PD risk. Further DNA methylation analysis identified two key methylation sites (cg00161556 and cg27379915), which indirectly influenced the occurrence of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene. Mediation effect analysis revealed that the methylation sites cg00161556 and cg27379915 indirectly promoted the development of PD by regulating the expression of the ZDHHC13 gene, with the mediation effect of ZDHHC13 gene expression accounting for 63.72% and 57.61% of the total effect, respectively. Sensitivity analysis and SMR analysis supported our findings, indicating high statistical robustness. This study highlights the role of DNA methylation in regulating ZDHHC13 during PD progression, suggesting potential clinical applications such as ZDHHC13 as a biomarker or therapeutic target for early PD diagnosis and treatment.",1
40088329,A Novel Fusion Framework Combining Graph Embedding Class-Based Convolutional Recurrent Attention Network with Brown Bear Optimization Algorithm for EEG-Based Parkinson's Disease Recognition.,"Parkinson's disease recognition (PDR) involves identifying Parkinson's disease using clinical evaluations, imaging studies, and biomarkers, focusing on early symptoms like tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia to facilitate timely treatment. However, due to noise, variability, and the non-stationary nature of EEG signals, distinguishing PD remains a challenge. Traditional deep learning methods struggle to capture the intricate temporal and spatial dependencies in EEG data, limiting their precision. To address this, a novel fusion framework called graph embedding class-based convolutional recurrent attention network with Brown Bear Optimization Algorithm (GECCR2ANet + BBOA) is introduced for EEG-based PD recognition. Preprocessing is conducted using numerical operations and noise removal with weighted guided image filtering and entropy evaluation weighting (WGIF-EEW). Feature extraction is performed via the improved VGG19 with graph triple attention network (IVGG19-GTAN), which captures spatial and temporal dependencies in EEG data. The extracted features are classified using the graph embedding class-based convolutional recurrent attention network (GECCR2ANet), further optimized through the Brown Bear Optimization Algorithm (BBOA) to enhance classification accuracy. The model achieves 99.9% accuracy, 99.4% sensitivity, and a 99.3% F1-score on the UNM dataset, and 99.8% accuracy, 99.1% sensitivity, and 99.2% F1-score on the UC San Diego dataset, significantly outperforming existing methods. Additionally, it records an error rate of 0.5% and a computing time of 0.25 s. Previous models like 2D-MDAGTS, A-TQWT, and CWCNN achieved below 95% accuracy, while the proposed model's 99.9% accuracy underscores its superior performance in real-world clinical applications, enhancing early PD detection and improving diagnostic efficiency.",1
40080233,The Potential of cfDNA as Biomarker: Opportunities and Challenges for Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by the progressive and gradual degeneration of neurons. The prevalence and rates of these disorders rise significantly with age. As life spans continue to increase in many countries, the number of cases is expected to grow in the foreseeable future. Early and precise diagnosis, along with appropriate surveillance, continues to pose a challenge. The high heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases calls for more accurate and definitive biomarkers to improve clinical therapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), including fragmented DNA released into bodily fluids via apoptosis, necrosis, or active secretion, has emerged as a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for various disorders including neurodegenerative diseases. cfDNA can serve as an indicator of ongoing cellular damage and mortality, including neuronal loss, and may provide valuable insights into disease processes, progression, and therapeutic responses. This review will first cover the key aspects of cfDNA and then examine recent advances in its potential use as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders.",1
40079631,[REM-Sleep-Behavior Disorder - More Than a Simple Parasomnia].,"Rapid-Eye-Movement (REM) sleep is an essential part of sleep dominating the second half of the night. A disturbance of the phy-siological muscle hypotonia of REM sleep can lead to dream enactment: REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). In the absence of a disease of the central nervous system or provoking factors such as sleep apnea, alcohol consumption or antidepressants, isolated RBD (iRBD) may be present. IRBD is an early stage of alpha-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multisystem atrophy. Medical history and polysomnography are the most important diagnostic tools. Clonazepam and melatonin are symptomatic treatments used to prevent injury. New technologies enable long-term monitoring of disease progression in iRBD and thus guide the targeted use of future disease-modifying therapies.

40079619,Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease: A Predictive Model Approach.,"The study aims to identify risk factors associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and to develop a predictive model to facilitate early clinical detection, diagnosis, and management, thereby enhancing patient prognosis and quality of life. A total of 351 PD patients were enrolled from the Department of Neurology at the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University between January 2022 and December 2023. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, and patients were subsequently categorized into cognitively normal (PD-NC) and cognitively impaired (PD-CI) groups. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors, and a predictive model was constructed and validated. Among the 351 patients with PD, 188 cases were in the PD⁃NC group and 163 cases were in the PD⁃CI group, with an incidence of cognitive impairment of 46.4%. Logistic regression analysis indicated that H-Y classification, HAMA score, homocysteine, uric acid, and folic acid were significant predictors and were incorporated into the regression equation. The constructed prediction model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.738. The cognitive function of PD patients is influenced by H-Y classification, HAMA score, homocysteine, uric acid, and folic acid. The constructed prediction model demonstrates good discrimination and calibration, providing a reference basis for early clinical identification and intervention of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease patients.",1
40077911,Establishment of a Biomarker-Directed Clinical Endpoint Model for Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease Patients.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra. While the interplay between dopamine loss and symptoms is well-recognized, a respective quantitative link has yet to be established. The objective was to establish a biomarker-directed clinical endpoint model for early-stage PD patients. We developed a disease progression model using DATscan data in 196 healthy subjects and 419 Parkinson's patients to characterize the onset and progression of disease in early-stage PD patients. This disease progression model was then linked to MDS-UPDRS Parts I, II, and III data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) using a modified item response theory (IRT) analysis to characterize and predict the impact of dopamine loss on motor and non-motor symptoms. Disease onset occurs ~4-15 years pre-diagnosis. There is correlation (Spearman's rank correlation: 0.73-0.78, P < 0.001) between striatal binding ratio values (SBR) and MDS-UPDRS total scores in early-stage PD patients once interindividual differences in age at diagnosis and onset of symptoms are considered. Stratification by degree of damage improved the model's performance for putamen/motor symptoms but not for caudate/cognitive symptoms. The model captured changes in MDS-UPDRS Parts I, II, and III in early-stage, moderately progressing PD patients (60-65% of PPMI patients). In conclusion, we developed an SBR-directed IRT model that characterizes changes in MDS-UPDRS in > 60% of early-stage PPMI patients for ~15 years.",1
40075106,Enhancing parkinson disease detection through feature based deep learning with autoencoders and neural networks.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with aging, leading to the progressive deterioration of certain regions of the brain. Accurate and timely diagnosis plays a crucial role in facilitating optimal therapy and improving patient outcomes. This study presents an innovative approach to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) through the examination of audio waves using Feature Based - Deep Neural Network (FB-DNN) techniques. Autoencoder, a specific form of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that is designed to excel in the task of feature extraction, is utilized in our study to effectively capture complex patterns present in audio data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are utilized in the task of classification, using the capabilities of deep learning (DL) to differentiate between audio samples that exhibit Parkinson's disease (PD) and those that do not. The deep neural network (DNN) model is trained using the retrieved data, allowing it to effectively distinguish minor variations in voice characteristics that are linked to Parkinson's disease. The suggested methodology not only enhances the precision of diagnosis but also enables prompt identification, perhaps resulting in more efficacious treatment methodologies. The present study introduces a potentially effective approach for the automated and non-intrusive identification of Parkinson's disease through the analysis of audio data. The integration of Autoencoder-based feature extraction with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) presents a dependable and easily accessible solution for the early detection and continuous monitoring of Parkinson's disease. This approach has promise for significantly improving the quality of life for persons affected by this condition. The implementation in Python was conducted as part of our experimentation. Upon analyzing the accuracy, it became apparent that the Feature-Based Deep Neural Network (FB-DNN) exhibited superior performance compared to the other models. Notably, the FB-DNN achieved the highest accuracy score of 96.15%.",1
40072076,Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Stem Cell's Perspective.,"Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a number of very heterogeneous disorders, primarily characterized by neuronal loss and a concomitant decline in neurological function. Examples of this type of clinical condition are Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Age has been identified as a major risk in the etiology of these disorders, which explains their increased incidence in developed countries. Unfortunately, despite continued and intensive efforts, no cure has yet been found for any of these diseases; reliable markers that allow for an early diagnosis of the disease and the identification of key molecular events leading to disease onset and progression are lacking. Altered adult neurogenesis appears to precede the appearance of severe symptoms. Given the scarcity of human samples and the considerable differences with model species, increasingly complex human stem-cell-based models are being developed. These are shedding light on the molecular alterations that contribute to disease development, facilitating the identification of new clinical targets and providing a screening platform for the testing of candidate drugs. Moreover, the secretome and other promising features of these cell types are being explored, to use them as replacement cells of high plasticity or as co-adjuvant therapy in combinatorial treatments.",1
40067783,Psychological stress associated with prognostic uncertainties in recently diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients: A qualitative study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that negatively impacts thousands of patients in Canada. The unexpected nature of PD is associated with a decline in mental health. The highest level of psychological stress occurs during the early years following the diagnosis. To understand the psychological stress associated with prognostic uncertainties in recently diagnosed PD patients, uncover the gaps in the current support systems, and recommend areas for improvement in the support services that aim to decrease the psychological stress associated with receiving the PD diagnosis. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 13 PD patients diagnosed for more than 6 months and less than 5 years. Participants were recruited from the Toronto Western Hospital Movement Disorders Clinic, Toronto, Ontario, Canada until saturation of key themes was reached. Five major themes were identified capturing the lived experiences of PD patients following diagnosis: 1) the circumstances of receiving the diagnosis and its psychological impact on PD patients, 2) the impact of intrapersonal factors on the PD journey, 3) the role of social relationships in PD patient's life, 4) the interaction of PD patients with different elements of the healthcare system, and 5) support services available for recently diagnosed PD patients. This study uncovers the psychological burden faced by PD patients due to prognostic uncertainties and insufficient support systems. It emphasizes the importance of a patient-centered approach for improving their quality of life and healthcare experiences through personalized support services.",1
40066251,Exploring the underlying molecular connections: a bioinformatics approach to link melanoma and Parkinson's disease.,"Melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, and Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, have been epidemiologically linked, showing a positive association that suggests a shared etiology. This association implies that individuals with one condition may have an increased risk of developing the other. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in both PD and melanoma to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to the pathophysiological overlap between these two conditions. We analyzed two independent publicly available genomic datasets to identify overlapping DEGs associated with both PD and melanoma. Regulatory networks, including transcription factors (TFs), DEGs, and microRNAs (miRNAs), were constructed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were established to identify hub genes. Additionally, we investigated the interplay between PD, melanoma, and immune cell infiltration to uncover potential correlations between the expression levels of hub genes and specific subsets of immune cells. Molecular docking studies were performed to identify potential therapeutic agents targeting the DEGs. A total of 41 overlapping DEGs were identified, including VSNL1, ATP6V1G2, and DNM1, which were significantly down-regulated in both PD and melanoma patients. These genes play critical roles in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions relevant to the pathogenesis of both diseases. VSNL1 is associated with synaptic vesicle fusion and may impact neuronal communication compromised in PD. ATP6V1G2, a subunit of the V-ATPase, is involved in the dysregulated pH homeostasis observed in melanoma. DNM1, a key player in vesicle trafficking, may influence aberrant cellular transport processes in both diseases. Regulatory and PPI networks revealed potential hub genes and their interactions. Molecular docking studies identified retinoic acid as a potential therapeutic agent targeting VSNL1, ATP6V1G2, and DNM1. Our study provides insights into the shared molecular characteristics of PD and melanoma, identifying potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis and revealing new therapeutic targets. The discovery of retinoic acid as a promising therapeutic agent represents a significant step forward in drug development and treatment strategies for these diseases. This comprehensive analysis enhances our understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying the association between PD and melanoma, paving the way for further research and therapeutic advancements. The findings hold the promise of improved diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment strategies for individuals affected by these debilitating diseases.",1
40062615,A novel integrative multimodal classifier to enhance the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with high heterogeneity, making early diagnosis difficult. Early detection and intervention are crucial for slowing PD progression. Understanding PD's diverse pathways and mechanisms is key to advancing knowledge. Recent advances in noninvasive imaging and multi-omics technologies have provided valuable insights into PD's underlying causes and biological processes. However, integrating these diverse data sources remains challenging, especially when deriving meaningful low-level features that can serve as diagnostic indicators. This study developed and validated a novel integrative, multimodal predictive model for detecting PD based on features derived from multimodal data, including hematological information, proteomics, RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and dopamine transporter scan imaging, sourced from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Several model architectures were investigated and evaluated, including support vector machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, fully connected neural networks with concatenation and joint modeling (FCNN_C and FCNN_JM), and a multimodal encoder-based model with multi-head cross-attention (MMT_CA). The MMT_CA model demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving a balanced classification accuracy of 97.7%, thus highlighting its ability to capture and leverage cross-modality inter-dependencies to aid predictive analytics. Furthermore, feature importance analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations not only identified crucial diagnostic biomarkers to inform the predictive models in this study but also holds potential for future research aimed at integrated functional analyses of PD from a multi-omics perspective, ultimately revealing targets required for precision medicine approaches to aid treatment of PD aimed at slowing down its progression.",1

40061041,A simple and effective screening strategy for early multiple system atrophy diagnosis and α-Synuclein forms in erythrocytes.,"Urinary dysfunction is an early manifestation of autonomic dysfunction in Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) and often precedes orthostatic hypotension. This study investigated the diagnostic efficacy of post-void residual (PVR) urine volume in differentiating possible MSA from early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) and sought to identify a feasible combination of autonomic nervous system indicators for clinical use. The distribution of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) forms in erythrocyte was preliminary explored. This study included 70 patients with MSA-P, 73 with MSA-C, and 71 with PD. All participants underwent assessments including bladder residual urine ultrasound, the supine-to-standing test (STS), external anal sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG), brain MRI, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined the diagnostic value of PVR urine volume and other autonomic indicators for possible MSA. Immunofluorescence staining of α-Syn forms in red blood cells (RBCs) was also performed. PVR urine volume, ΔSBP and ΔDBP (at 1 and 3 min), and EAS-EMG parameters were significantly increased in MSA-P and MSA-C patients compared to PD ( Combining PVR urine volume and ΔSBP (at 1 and 3 min) is an easily accessible and effective method for distinguishing possible MSA from early-stage PD. This combination should be considered for routine assessment in Parkinsonism. Distinct α-Syn forms distribution in erythrocytes could be considered as a useful biomarker for differential diagnosis.",1
40057850,Electrochemical Biosensors for the Detection of Exosomal microRNA Biomarkers for Early Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Early and precise diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) is crucial for slowing their progression and enhancing patient outcomes. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as promising biomarkers due to their ability to reflect the diseases' pathology, yet their low abundance poses significant detection hurdles. This review article delves into the burgeoning field of electrochemical biosensors, designed for the precise detection of exosomal miRNA biomarkers. Electrochemical biosensors offer a compelling solution, combining the sensitivity required to detect low-abundance biomarkers with the specificity needed to discern miRNA profiles distinctive to neural pathological states. We explore the operational principles of these biosensors, including the electrochemical transduction mechanisms that facilitate miRNA detection. The review also summarizes advancements in nanotechnology, signal enhancement, bioreceptor anchoring, and microfluidic integration that improve sensor accuracy. The evidence of their use in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis is analyzed, focusing on the clinical impact, diagnostic precision, and obstacles faced in practical applications. Their potential integration into point-of-care testing and regulatory considerations for their market entry are discussed. Looking toward the future, the article highlights forthcoming innovations that might revolutionize early diagnostic processes. Electrochemical biosensors, with their impressive sensitivity, specificity, and point-of-care compatibility, are on track to become instrumental in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, possibly transforming patient care and prognosis.",1
40056910,Single extracellular vesicle detection assay identifies membrane-associated α-synuclein as an early-stage biomarker in Parkinson's disease.,"Accurate diagnosis of early Parkinson's disease requires platforms suitable for detecting minute amounts of neuronally derived biomarkers in the massive protein excess of easily accessible biofluids such as blood. Here, we describe an on-chip droplet-confined fluorescence reporting assay that identified α-synuclein on the membrane of L1CAM+ extracellular vesicles (EVs) immunocaptured from human serum and corroborate this finding by super-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) microscopy. Using conditioned media from neuroblastoma cells expressing α-synuclein mutants or patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons with α-synuclein gene triplication, we found that association of α-synuclein with the L1CAM+ EV surface is increased under pathological conditions. Accordingly, this readout, as measured by the droplet-based assay, is an improved predictive biomarker in the prodromal phase (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.93) or diagnostic biomarker in the clinical phase (AUC = 0.95) of Parkinson's disease. More broadly, our platform will simplify the assessment of EV membrane proteins and facilitate their application as diagnostic biomarkers across diverse clinical indications.",1
40054760,Anatomical abnormalities suggest a compensatory role of the cerebellum in early Parkinson's disease.,"Brain atrophy is detected in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and accelerates over the first few years post-diagnosis. This was captured by multiple cross-sectional studies and a few longitudinal studies in early PD. Yet only a longitudinal study with a control group can capture accelerated atrophy in early PD and differentiate it from healthy ageing. Accordingly, we performed a multicohort longitudinal analysis between PD and healthy ageing, examining subcortical regions implicated in PD pathology, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum (CC), and cerebellum. Longitudinal volumetric analysis was performed on 56 early PD patients and 53 matched controls, with scans collected 2-3 years apart. At baseline, the PD group showed a greater volume in the pallidum, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter (WM), suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in prodromal and early PD. After 2-3 years, accelerated atrophy in PD was observed in the putamen and cerebellar WM. Interestingly, healthy controls - but not PD patients - demonstrated a significant decline in Total Intracranial Volume (TIV), and atrophy in the thalamus and mid-CC. Between-group analysis revealed more severe atrophy in the right striatum and cerebellar WM in PD, and in the mid-posterior CC in controls. Using CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES) for lobule segmentation on the longitudinal PD cohort, we found a significant decline in the WM of non-motor regions in the cerebellum, specifically Crus I and lobule IX. Our results highlight an initial increase in cerebellar WM volume during prodromal PD, followed by significant degeneration over the first few years post-diagnosis.",1
40053624,Detection of Early Parkinson's Disease by Leveraging Speech Foundation Models.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, characterized by a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Among these symptoms, alterations in speech and voice quality stand out as early and prominent indicators of the disease. Recently, the emergence of speech foundation models has revolutionized the field by providing powerful tools for speech processing and feature extraction. In this article, we investigate the capabilities of three state-of the art speech foundation models, wav2vec2.0, Whisper and SeamlessM4T, to develop robust and accurate methods for PD detection from voice recordings. We experiment with both direct feature extraction and finetuning of the foundation models for the PD classification task, and validate the results against clinical and neuroimaging data. We achieve promising results using both pretrained features and models' finetuning, with finetuning providing stronger performance, up to 91.35% for AUC, which is the new state of the art on the ICEBERG dataset. The predictions of our models also show good correlation with clinical as well as DaTSCAN scores, proving the feasibility to apply speech foundation models for detection of early PD.",1
40053183,Gait changes with aging: an early warning sign for underlying pathology.,"Walking may appear to be a simple motor task, but is in fact a very complex behavior that involves virtually all levels of the nervous system. In daily clinical practice, subtle gait changes are commonly observed as we grow older, and these are often attributed to aging itself (the term ""senile gait"" was coined for this). However, growing evidence suggests that such age-related gait changes should not be regarded as a mere consequence of aging, but rather as indicators of underlying age-related disease. Numerous studies have shown that gait changes can be present for years during an otherwise prodromal phase of many progressive neurological disorders. As such, gait changes serve as clinical biomarkers of disease-related dysfunction in the neurological structures involved in gait control. We elaborate on the potential for gait to be exploited as an early warning system for underlying pathology. We also discuss the importance of such a proactive approach: an earlier diagnosis can lead to timely installment of symptomatic support, and sometimes start of prophylactic treatment. This can help reduce disability, and possibly increase survival because age-related gait disturbances are associated with increased mortality in the general population.",1
40049433,Detection of hypochlorous acid fluctuation via a near-infrared fluorescent probe in Parkinson's disease cells and mouse models.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by excessive reactive halogen species leading to the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which disrupts the coordination of normal physiological structures and functions. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a reactive halogen species whose overproduction is associated with the death of DA neurons. Herein, overproduction of HOCl may be a neurotoxin substance in the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, it is essential to understand the disease of HOCl in PD model. However, early detection HOCl in PD model remains lacking of effective methods. In this study, a high sensitivity off-on near-infrared probe (MB-HOCl) was designed and synthesized. MB-HOCl showed a quantitative response toward HOCl (0-100 μM) with detection limit of 0.32 μM. Importantly, MB-HOCl was capable of selectively and specially detecting exogenous and endogenous HOCl in PC-12 cells and was successfully used for imaging in PD mice models. All results demonstrate that the probe (MB-HOCl) holds great promise for understanding the disease and diagnosis of HOCl-mediated PD models.",1
40046673,A signature combining brain functional connectivity with executive and motor function for general cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.,"Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliance on neuropsychological testing alone can lead to delayed identification, and an objective and comprehensive approach is needed in clinical practice. We assessed brain functional connectivity during PD-MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and PD-NC (normal cognition) patients, and healthy controls (HC) completing the Stroop color-word test (SCWT) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and explored the predictive value of combining relevant brain function and behavioral information for general cognitive decline in PD. Nineteen patients with PD-MCI, 21 with PD-NC and 33 age-matched HC were recruited. Group differences in executive performance and prefrontal functional connectivity were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to measure the value of combining brain functional connectivity with executive and motor function in predicting PD-MCI. During the color-word incongruent test, PD-MCI patients had significantly lower correct rate than HC and PD-NC patients. Meanwhile, PD-MCI patients exhibited significantly increased regional strength of the left and right prefrontal cortex (RS We proposed a signature combining brain functional connectivity with executive and motor function for general cognitive decline in PD, which could provide new insights into early detection and intervention of this problem.",1
40046201,Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease and Neuro-ophthalmological Findings: A Study on Neurodegeneration in the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer and Cognitive Functions.,"This study was designed to explore the relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and cognition in Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients without visual symptoms or diagnosis of dementia. Groups of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and healthy controls were compared ophthalmologically using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and cognitively through neuropsychological tests. The findings highlighted a pronounced RNFL thinning, especially in the right nasal inferior quadrant of IPD patients compared to the control group. Almost half (47%) of the subjects in the IPD group exhibited issues in one or multiple subcomponents of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). At the same time, the study suggested that effects in the visuospatial domain may be associated with disease severity in IPD patients. However, the investigation could not establish a direct association between the severity or duration of the disease and OCT measurements. A correlation was observed between certain ACE-R scores and some RNFL quadrants. In conclusion, the inception phases of IPD are characterized by discernable visual pathologies and cognitive anomalies. The thinning of the RNFL, which can be identified through OCT, might serve as a pivotal tool for tracking the early progression of IPD and formulating intervention strategies. That being said, more comprehensive studies are essential to wholly understand OCT's role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of IPD.",1
40045807,Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and a streamlined six-step algorithm endorsed by the Italian Society of Neurosurgery (SINCH).,"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a treatable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a triad of gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial for optimal outcomes. However, the diagnosis of iNPH remains challenging due to its variable presentation and overlap with other neurological conditions. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify current diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies for iNPH. Based on this review, a novel, six-step algorithm was developed to streamline the diagnostic process and improve patient outcomes. The proposed algorithm includes the following six steps: 1) suspect diagnosis of iNPH: Identification of core clinical features (gait disturbance, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence) and radiological evidence of ventricular enlargement; 2) investigate probable iNPH: detailed neuropsychological assessment, gait analysis, and urodynamic studies to confirm the diagnosis; 3) high-volume lumbar puncture: evaluation of the clinical response to CSF drainage, including improvements in gait, cognition, and urinary function; 4) evaluation after HVLP: assessment of the duration and magnitude of symptom improvement after lumbar puncture; 5) shunt surgery: indication for shunt surgery in patients with a positive response to CSF drainage; 6) infusion test and intracranial pressure measurement: alternative diagnostic tools for cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain. The proposed algorithm provides a structured approach to the diagnosis and management of iNPH. By combining clinical, radiological, and neurophysiological assessments, clinicians can improve diagnostic accuracy and optimize patient outcomes. Further research is needed to validate this algorithm in larger patient populations and to develop more sensitive and specific biomarkers for iNPH.",1
40045806,Treatment of iNPH: novel insights.,"This review advocates for a shift from traditional symptom-based diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) to a deeper investigation into its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly the role of altered cerebral hydrodynamics as an important pathological hallmark. We explore the heterogeneity of iNPH, emphasizing its frequent overlap and cooccurrence with neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, and subcortical vascular encephalopathy, complicating diagnosis and treatment strategies. The lumbar infusion test emerges as a useful diagnostic tool, offering quantitative insights into CSF outflow resistance that should be considered as a useful biomarker related to cerebral hydrodynamics and iNPH pathophysiology. Furthermore, we propose the hypothesis that shunt placement, by regulating brain fluid mechanics, may also serve as a form of neuromodulation, potentially enhancing neuronal function and mitigating clinical symptoms. This review advocates for an interdisciplinary, physics-based and patient-centered approach that emphasizes early detection, accurate diagnostics, and personalized treatment plans to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life, particularly in the aging population.",1
40039816,Explainable framework to detect Parkinson's disease related depression from EEG.,"Depression is a non-motor symptom inherent to Parkinson's disease (PD). As an early manifestation of PD, PD-related depression is hard to diagnose, thereby contributing to morbidity. Recent endeavors have employed deep learning networks to assist in the diagnosis of PD and depression, achieving commendable levels of accuracy. However, little attention has been directed toward PD-related depression, and the decision process of the network lacks transparency and explainability. What has been learned by the network and whether pathological mechanisms contribute to the classifier's result remain mysterious. In this study, we propose an explainable functional connectivity framework to recognize depression in PD. Specifically, the diagnosis feature extraction module learns high-dimensional information from functional connectivity features, followed by the diagnosis module making decisions. Furthermore, the explainable module provides interpretation and validation for the decisions on functional connectivity. Evaluation of the dataset demonstrates superb subject-wise predictive performance and provides visual evidence of the underlying pathology in EEG. The interpretation results bridge the gap between pathophysiological mechanisms and computer-aided diagnosis.",1
40039710,Video-based Clinical Gait Analysis in Parkinson's Disease: A Novel Approach Using Frontal Plane Videos and Machine Learning.,"Gait can be significantly impaired by neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Gait impairments can be quantified by using instrumented gait analysis techniques, but these instrumented techniques are expensive and suffer from limited accessibility in clinical practice. This paper introduces a method utilizing machine learning algorithms for video-based clinical gait analysis of frontal plane videos recorded with readily available devices. Our approach leverages open-source body pose (Google's MediaPipe) and metric depth (ZoeDepth) estimators to calculate spatiotemporal parameters (STP) of gait from videos and demonstrated high agreement and correlation with traditional marker-based motion capture (MoCap). We applied our proposed methodology to gait videos of healthy controls and people with PD (PWP). Our results agree with those obtained with high-end instrumental gait analysis techniques and support the detection of PD from gait videos.Clinical Relevance- This study presents an innovative, user-friendly, and cost-effective solution for clinical gait analysis. It will enable automated gait analysis via videos in gait-impaired individuals such as PWP, paving the way for telemedicine evaluation for movement decline. The future impact is early detection, effective remote monitoring, and new treatments for increased fall risk in an already mobility-challenged population.",1
40039655,Eye-tracking in Mixed Reality for Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Parkinson's disease ranks as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally. This research aims to develop a system leveraging Mixed Reality capabilities for tracking and assessing eye movements. In this paper, we present a medical scenario and outline the development of an application designed to capture eye-tracking signals through Mixed Reality technology for the evaluation of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we introduce a pipeline for extracting clinically relevant features from eye-gaze analysis, describing the capabilities of the proposed system from a medical perspective. The study involved a cohort of healthy control individuals and patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, showcasing the feasibility and potential of the proposed technology for non-intrusive monitoring of eye movement patterns for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.Clinical relevance- Developing a non-invasive biomarker for Parkinson' s disease is urgently needed to accurately detect the disease's onset. This would allow for the timely introduction of neuroprotective treatment at the earliest stage and enable the continuous monitoring of intervention outcomes. The ability to detect subtle changes in eye movements allows for early diagnosis, offering a critical window for intervention before more pronounced symptoms emerge. Eye tracking provides objective and quantifiable biomarkers, ensuring reliable assessments of disease progression and cognitive function. The eye gaze analysis using Mixed Reality glasses is wireless, facilitating convenient assessments in both home and hospital settings. The approach offers the advantage of utilizing hardware that requires no additional specialized attachments, enabling examinations through personal eyewear.",1
40039618,Towards dopaminergic SPECT estimation from structural MRI sequences to characterize Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease is associated with the progressive death of dopaminergic neurons producing motor disorders at advanced stages. Today, there is no definitive biomarker to early detect and diagnose the disease (80% of the dopaminergic neurons are lost at first diagnosis). Recently, neuroimages have allowed to discover radiological markers associated with structural alterations from routine T1-MRI, and even measure dopamine activations in specialized SPECT sequences. Nonetheless, SPECT sequences are highly specialized, with low availability in clinical centers, and the respective analysis and quantification remain subjective and poorly explored. This work introduces a self-supervised deep representation able to capture dopaminergic levels from an MRI-to-SPECT transformation, learning an embedding representation with the capability to classify between Parkinson's and control subjects. From a retrospective study with a set of 73 Parkinson's and 73 control patients, the proposed approach achieved a notable discrimination of 79% in the precision metric.Clinical relevance- A self-supervised representation that under a translation MRI-to-SPECT task, can code dopaminergic levels to discriminate between control and Parkinson's subjects.",1
40037167,"Deep learning models for improving Parkinson's disease management regarding disease stage, motor disability and quality of life.","Motor diagnosis, monitoring and management of Parkinson's disease (PD) focuses mainly on observational methods and, clinical scales, resulting in a subjective evaluation. Inertial sensors combined with artificial intelligence have emerged as a promising solution to help physicians perform early, differential, and objective quantification of motor symptoms over time. We hypothesize that a long short-term memory-deep neural network (LSTM) architecture could be an appropriate solution for producing three models to provide a holistic assessment of patients with PD from a single inertial sensor. A custom dataset with 40 patients was created to train and test three deep learning models to classify PD disease stages, motor conditions and quality of life (QoL). We verified an accuracy of 89 % for the disease stage classifier, 91.7 % for the motor condition classifier, and an accuracy of 87.8 % for the QoL classifier. We confirmed that an LSTM architecture could produce three models to improve PD management.",1
40036439,Multi-Scale and Multi-Level Feature Assessment Framework for Classification of Parkinson's Disease State From Short-Term Motor Tasks.,"Recent quantification research on Parkinson's disease (PD) integrates wearable technology with machine learning methods, indicating a strong potential for practical applications. However, the effectiveness of these techniques is influenced by environmental settings and is hardly applied in real-world situations. This paper aims to propose an effective feature assessment framework to automatically rate the severity of PD motor symptoms from short-term motor tasks, and then classify different PD severity levels in the real world. This paper identified specific PD motor symptoms using a novel feature-assessment framework at both segment-level and sample-level. Features were selected after calculating SHapley Additive exPlanation(SHAP) value, and verified by different machine learning methods with appropriate parameters. This framework has been verified on real-world data from 100 PD patients performing Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS)-recommended short motor tasks, each task lasting 20-50 seconds. The sensitivity for recognizing motor fluctuations reached 88% in tremor recognition. Additionally, LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy for early detection(92.59%) and achieved 71.58% in fine-grained severity classification using 31 selected features. This paper reports the first effort to assess multi-level and multi-scale features for automatic quantification of motor symptoms and PD severity levels. The proposed framework has been proven effective in assessing key PD information for recognition during short-term tasks. The explanatory analysis of digital features in this study provides more prior knowledge for PD self-assessment in a free-living environment.",1
40035544,Hybrid ladybug Hawk optimization-enabled deep learning for multimodal Parkinson's disease classification using voice signals and hand-drawn images.,"PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to gradual motor impairments. Early detection is critical for slowing the disease's progression and providing patients access to timely therapies. However, accurately detecting PD in its early stages remains challenging. This study aims to develop an optimized deep learning model for PD classification using voice signals and hand-drawn spiral images, leveraging a ZFNet-LHO-DRN. The proposed model first preprocesses the input voice signal using a Gaussian filter to remove noise. Features are then extracted from the preprocessed signal and passed to ZFNet to generate output-1. For the hand-drawn spiral image, preprocessing is performed with a bilateral filter, followed by image augmentation. Here also, the features are extracted and forwarded to DRN to form output-2. Both classifiers are trained using the LHO algorithm. Finally, from the output-1 and output-2, the best one is selected based on the majority voting. The ZFNet-LHO-DRN model demonstrated excellent performance by achieving a premium accuracy of 89.8%, a NPV of 89.7%, a PPV of 89.7%, a TNR of 89.3%, and a TPR of 90.1%. The model's high accuracy and performance indicate its potential as a valuable tool for assisting in the early diagnosis of PD.",1
40034434,Digital Phenotyping of Parkinson's Disease via Natural Language Processing.,"Frontostriatal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with language deficits, which can be identified using natural language processing, a remarkable tool for digital phenotyping. Current evidence is limited in linguistic coverage and mostly blind to the disorder's cognitive phenotypes. We validated an AI-driven approach to capture digital language markers of PD with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, PD-nMCI) relative to healthy controls (HCs). Analyzing the connected speech samples of participants, we extracted linguistic features with CLAN software. Classification was performed using Support Vector Machine and Recursive Feature Elimination. Discrimination between PD and HCs reached an AUC of 77%, with even better results for subgroup analyses (AUC 85% PD-nMCI vs. HCs; 83% PD-MCI vs. HCs; 75% PD-nMCI vs. PD-MCI). Key linguistic features included retracing ratio, action verb ratio, utterance error ratio, and verbless-utterance ratio, highlighting the foundational capabilities of linguistic digital markers for early diagnosis and phenotyping of PD.",1
40031174,DoctorPupil: A Virtual Reality System for Parkinson's Diagnosis Through Task-Evoked Pupil Response.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most critical neurodegenerative diseases, yet there is no cure for it, and the state-of-the-art treatment is to slow its progression. Thus, the earlier a patient with PD is recognized, the better he can be treated. Our project joins the research effort that aims to support early PD diagnosis by designing a Virtual Reality (VR)-based system to monitor pupil diameter patterns as new biomarkers (e.g., Pupil Light Reflex and Task-evoked Pupil Response) and provide early warning of potential PD onset. A follow-up experiment with 55 participants shows that the accuracy of recognizing early PD from healthy controls could reach 0.8942. Our study shows early results of a promising research direction that leverages VR-based technology to non-intrusively recognize patterns and provide alerts to early PD patients who would otherwise not know their symptoms until much later.",1
40030782,Addressing Multiple Challenges in Early Gait Freezing Prediction for Parkinson's Disease: A Practical Deep Learning Approach.,"Freezing of Gait (FOG) significantly impacts daily activities of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Despite the potential of wearable sensors in predicting FOG, challenges persist, including the brief prediction interval before FOG onset, limited generalization across patients, and the inconvenience of multiple sensors. Addressing one issue often aggravates others, making it difficult to achieve suitable concurrent solutions to all these challenges. We introduce the PhysioGait Predictive Network (PhysioGPN), a deep learning framework designed to predict FOG events in PD patients at least 2 seconds prior to onset. The model architecture incorporates four key strategies: (1) Detection of progressive motion changes using large convolutional kernels; (2) Unraveling the complexity of motion coordination and gait dynamics using multi-dimensional and multi-scale convolution; (3) Capture gait self-similarity and asymmetry with twin-tower structure; (4) Promoting cross-domain information exchange with multi-domain attention. Furthermore, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation (KD), reducing the model's dependence on multiple sensors while maintaining prediction accuracy. The model achieves an 85.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC) in FOG prediction. When reducing the number of sensors, KD mitigates the decline in performance and increases the AUC by 5.1%, compared to scenarios without KD. Our research proposes a practical solution to the challenges of FOG prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of the KD approach for lightweight wearable sensors in rehabilitation engineering. Our findings offer valuable insights for addressing multiple challenges in the practical application of wearable devices.",1
40030411,Topological Gait Analysis: A New Framework and Its Application to the Study of Human Gait.,"This study introduces a physiologically driven topological gait analysis (TGA) framework to gain insights into pathological gait. A publicly available gait dataset consisting of four groups: healthy adults, people with Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was used. The topological properties of the configuration space of three gait parameters were studied by approximating the underlying distribution through a Gaussian kernel-based density estimation technique. Thereafter, sublevel sets of the density estimate were analyzed using cubical persistence homology. Three new features were constructed: 1. Probability density estimates (PDEs) that characterize the distribution of gait parameters over their configuration space. Healthy adults exhibited a unimodal distribution, while people with neurodegenerative disorders displayed a multi-modal distribution. 2. Persistence entropy plots that summarize changes in the PDEs and characterize the uncertainty in the underlying distribution. Gait of healthy adults was concentrated at higher entropy values as opposed to neurodegenerative gait. 3. A number that captures disease severity trends. Topological features in PD and HD indicate a 'bias' to a certain set of gait configurations. This lack of exploration may reflect poor planning of the underlying topology, resulting in outward manifestations of impaired gait. The lower variegations in PDEs in ALS compared to PD and HD suggest that the planning of the topology of gait may occur at higher levels of the neural architecture. TGA offers characterization of gait at a hitherto uncharted level, potentially serving neuromotor markers for early diagnosis and personalized rehabilitation protocols.",1
40029495,Deep Learning-Based Diagnostic Model for Parkinson's Disease Using Handwritten Spiral and Wave Images.,"To develop and validate a deep neural network (DNN) model for diagnosing Parkinson's Disease (PD) using handwritten spiral and wave images, and to compare its performance with various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. The study utilized a dataset of 204 images (102 spiral and 102 wave) from PD patients and healthy subjects. The images were preprocessed using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor and augmented to increase dataset diversity. The DNN model was designed with an input layer, three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, two dropout layers, and two dense layers. The model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and loss. The DNN model was compared with nine ML models (random forest, logistic regression, AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbor, gradient boost, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, decision tree) and two DL models (convolutional neural network, DenseNet-201). The DNN model outperformed all other models in diagnosing PD from handwritten spiral and wave images. On spiral images, the DNN model achieved accuracies of 41.24% over naïve Bayes, 31.24% over decision tree, and 27.9% over support vector machine. On wave images, the DNN model achieved accuracies of 40% over naïve Bayes, 36.67% over decision tree, and 30% over support vector machine. The DNN model demonstrated significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity compared to other models. The DNN model significantly improves the accuracy of PD diagnosis using handwritten spiral and wave images, outperforming several ML and DL models. This approach offers a promising diagnostic tool for early PD detection and provides a foundation for future work to incorporate additional features and enhance detection accuracy.",1
40029109,Metallic nanomaterials in Parkinson's disease: a transformative approach for early detection and targeted therapy.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to both motor and non-motor symptoms that significantly impact quality of life. The prevalence of PD is expected to increase with the aging population, affecting millions globally. Current detection techniques, including clinical assays and neuroimaging, lack the sensitivity and specificity to sense PD in its earliest stages. Despite extensive research, there is no cure for PD, and available treatments primarily focus on symptomatic relief rather than halting disease progression. Conventional treatments, such as levodopa and dopamine agonists, provide limited and often temporary relief, with long-term use associated with significant side effects and diminished efficacy. Nanotechnology, particularly the use of metallic-based nanomaterials (MNMs), offers a promising approach to overcome these limitations. MNMs, due to their unique physicochemical properties, can be engineered to target specific cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in PD. These MNMs can improve drug delivery, enhance imaging and biosensing techniques, and provide neuroprotective effects. For example, gold and silver nanoparticles have shown potential in crossing the blood-brain barrier, providing real-time imaging for early diagnosis and delivering therapeutic agents directly to the affected neurons. This review aims to reveal the current advancements in the use of MNMs for the detection and treatment of PD. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the limitations of conventional detection techniques and therapies, followed by a detailed discussion on how nanotechnology can address these challenges. The review will also highlight recent preclinical research and examine the potential toxicity of MNMs. By emphasizing the potential of MNMs, this review article aims to underscore the transformative impact of nanotechnology in revolutionizing the detection and treatment of PD.",1
40029012,Reported Symptoms in Prodromal and Early Motor Parkinson's Disease: A Scoping Review on the Patient Perspective.,"The lived experience of Parkinson's disease (PD) includes motor and non-motor symptoms. There is a need to capture the earliest patient experiences in a sensitive and reliable manner for the successful development of interventions that may delay clinical progression in PD. Our aim was to synthesize published literature about patient-reported symptoms in prodromal and early motor stages of PD and develop a conceptual framework of the earliest lived experiences in PD. We conducted a scoping review of the published literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL databases and abstracted patient-reported symptoms from included studies reporting on prodromal or early motor stages of PD populations. We included 59 articles with data from 64 cohorts (prodromal PD: n = 20/64; 31%, early motor PD: n = 44/64, 69%). Overall, the 10 most frequent symptoms (of 85 standardized reported symptoms [SRSs]) were non-motor. SRSs were grouped into symptom domains (behavioral, cognition, dysautonomia, motor, sensory, sleep, and others) and functional domains (activities of daily living, communication, sexual, and social impairment). The Movement Disorder Society sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts Ib and II (n = 13/64, 20%) and ad hoc questionnaires (n = 12/64, 19%) were the most frequently used measurement tools. At prodromal and early motor stages of PD, individuals report symptoms of a diverse range of motor and non-motor domains and higher-level functional domains. There is a need to capture the full spectrum of this lived experience in a new patient-reported clinical outcome measure for clinical trials in the earliest clinical stages of PD.",1
40028124,Inspecting the Triazole Scaffold as Powerful Antifibril Agents against 2N4R Tau and α-Synuclein Aggregates.,"Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease are neurodegenerative disorders that are considered to be a significant global health challenge due to their increasing prevalence and profound impact on both individuals and society. These disorders are characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal function, leading to cognitive and motor impairments. A key pathological feature of AD and PD is the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins within the brain. In AD, amyloid-beta aggregates into plaques, while tau proteins form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Parkinson's disease, on the other hand, is marked by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in the form of Lewy bodies (LBs). These protein aggregates are involved in neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration, contributing to disease progression. Research efforts are increasingly focused on identifying small molecules that can simultaneously target multiple pathological processes, offering the potential to not only alleviate symptoms but also modify the progression of neurodegeneration. Herein, a novel group of triazole-based compounds was designed and synthesized to curtail the aggregation of α-syn and tau proteins, which are closely linked to the physiopathology of PD and AD, respectively. A thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay was used to measure fibril formation and assess the antiaggregation effects of various compounds. To further validate these findings, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed as a direct method to visualize the impact of these compounds on fibril morphology. Inhibition of oligomer formation was evaluated using photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP), enabling the detection of early protein aggregation events. During fibril formation assays, three compounds (",1
40025787,Seeding amplification assay: Limitations and insights for enhanced clinical and research applications.,"The accurate diagnosis of synucleinopathies-neurodegenerative diseases marked by misfolded α-synuclein protein aggregates, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy-remains a critical challenge. Conventional clinical criteria, frequently verified only through postmortem examination, results in diagnostic delays that impede timely intervention. Seeding amplification assay (SAA) has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool, offering high sensitivity for detecting α-synuclein aggregates even in early disease stages. While SAA enables early diagnosis by amplifying misfolded α-synuclein in biological samples, several barriers exist, including a lack of assay standardization, technical complexity, and difficulty differentiating among synucleinopathies. Additionally, the current SAA is primarily qualitative, limiting their ability to correlate with disease severity or progression. This review addresses these limitations by examining pre-analytical and analytical factors influencing SAA performance and exploring emerging quantitative approaches. Recent advancements include the integration of SAA with quantitative methodologies, which hold promise for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and clinical applicability. SAA's potential as a diagnostic and monitoring tool is significant and can be further improved by validation in longitudinal studies. The clinical implementation of SAA could revolutionize the early detection and management of synucleinopathies, ultimately improving patient outcomes through earlier diagnosis and tailored therapeutic strategies. Diagnosing Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy can be challenging. These conditions, called synucleinopathies, are caused by harmful changes in a protein called α-synuclein that causes it to clump or aggregate. Doctors often rely on looking for symptoms of the disease to form a diagnosis, but confirmation usually happens only after death when the brain regions affected can be tested for the presence of α-synuclein aggregates. This results in challenges in providing timely treatment. A new lab test called the seeding amplification assay (SAA) shows promise for detecting changes in α-synuclein early, even before symptoms appear. SAA works by amplifying small amounts of this misfolded protein in samples from patients, making it easier to detect. However, the test has limitations. It is complex, not standardized across labs, and struggles to tell apart the different synucleinopathies. SAA also provides “yes” or “no” answers and cannot yet quantify the levels of the α-synuclein aggregates present and how severe or advanced the disease is. This review explores ways to improve SAA. It looks at how factors like sample handling and lab techniques affect results and highlights new methods that make SAA more accurate and quantitative. By combining SAA with technologies that can quantify protein levels more precisely, and studying SAA results of patients over time, the test could help doctors diagnose these diseases earlier and track their progression. Early diagnosis means patients could receive treatments tailored to their needs sooner, improving their quality of life.",1
40020415,Fast susceptibility-weighted imaging using echo planar imaging at 1.5 T for swallow tail sign biomarker detection in Parkinson's disease.,"This study evaluated the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of a fast-imaging technique combining Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) and Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI) at 1.5 T for visualizing the Swallow Tail Sign (STS) in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The STS, a biomarker linked to PD pathogenesis, offers promise for non-invasive diagnosis. However, conventional SWI often requires high field strengths and lengthy scan times, limiting accessibility. This study aimed to provide a faster, more practical alternative for PD diagnosis. A prospective study included 130 participants (22 early-stage PD, 108 healthy controls [HC]) recruited consecutively from a neurology clinic. Eligibility required freedom from MRI contraindications. A fast EPI-SWI sequence was employed as the primary diagnostic tool, with Movement Disorder Society criteria serving as the reference standard. Diagnostic measures, including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), were calculated. After excluding participants with motion artifacts or suboptimal image quality, 120 participants (20 PD, 100 HC) were included in the analysis. The fast EPI-SWI technique demonstrated 100 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 83.3 %, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100 %. The AUC for diagnostic accuracy was 0.98. The fast EPI-SWI sequence at 1.5 T achieved high diagnostic accuracy for detecting the STS, offering a practical solution for early PD diagnosis in settings with limited access to high-field MRI. The use of EPI SWI for detecting the Swallow Tail Sign could provide a faster and more accessible method for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in clinical settings, particularly in resource-limited environments.",1
40019135,Polygenic Risk Score Combined with Transcranial Sonography Refines Parkinson's Disease Risk Prediction.,"Dopaminergic neuron depletion in the substantia nigra (SN) and the pathological aggregation of α-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate the association between the polygenic risk score for PD (PD-PRS) and transcranial sonography (TCS)-measured SN hyperechogenicity to enhance the accuracy of PD susceptibility prediction. PD-PRSs were calculated for over 41,000 Estonian Biobank participants age 55+ years without a PD diagnosis. Participants in the highest and lowest PD-PRS percentiles (n = 222) underwent TCS measurements and Sniffin' sticks olfactory testing. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between PD-PRS, risk and prodromal markers, and SN hyperechogenicity. Data from 204 participants with TCS measurements were analyzed, including 107 individuals in the high-risk PD-PRS group and 97 in the low-risk PD-PRS group. Incorporating PD-PRS group assignment improved the explained variance in SN hyperechogenicity from 17.2% to 31.9%. Participants in the low-risk PD-PRS group had 0.16 times lower odds (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07-0.35, P < 0.001) of developing SN hyperechogenicity compared to high-risk PD-PRS individuals. Each unit increase in the Sniffin' sticks olfactory test score was significantly associated with reduced odds of SN hyperechogenicity (adjusted odds ratio = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.47-0.78, P = 0.002). Our findings indicate that TCS-measured SN hyperechogenicity is associated with PD-PRS and olfactory impairment. This combined assessment may improve early diagnosis of prodromal PD by pinpointing individuals at increased risk.",1
40017568,From Diagnosis to Treatment: A Comprehensive Review of Biomarkers and Therapeutic Advances in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor symptoms. Ongoing research shows promise for long-term solutions. Studies highlight the dysregulation of Syt11 and α-synuclein (α-syn) in PD. Disrupted α-syn homeostasis due to palmitoylation of Syt11 contributes to its aggregation, potentially playing a role in PD pathology. α-synuclein aggregates in stool samples show promise as an early diagnostic biomarker. Vocal impairments in PD may be linked to α-syn-induced neuropathology. Irisin, produced after exercise, promotes the degradation of pathologic α-syn. Progress has been made in identifying PD biomarkers. Retinal thinning and abnormal protein aggregates in skin biopsies provide noninvasive diagnostic indicators. Blood-based biomarkers like α-syn, DJ-1, and LRRK2 hold promise but face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI) models enhance mitophagy, detect PD through sleep-breathing signals, and improve survival. AI analysis aids noninvasive assessment and risk prediction. Further understanding of PD involves studying pathological seeds and genetic mutations. Adenosine receptor regulation relates to early-onset PD, and specific gene mutations impact patient survival. Differentiated-induced pluripotent stem cells offer the potential for cell replacement therapy. Autoimmune features and T-cell involvement suggest intervention targets. Stem cell-based therapies and neurostimulation strategies show promise for improving motor function. Imaging reveals increased central inflammation in PD, suggesting an inflammatory role. Machine learning algorithms and home gait speed monitoring aid in diagnosis and disease progression tracking. Abnormal putamen gradients reflect dopaminergic loss and motor dysfunction. Antiepileptic drug prescriptions are associated with an increased PD risk. Personalized medicine, gut-brain axis involvement, and vestibular stimulation therapy offer potential PD treatment avenues. Genetic engineering techniques and deep brain stimulation show promise for alleviating PD symptoms. Ongoing research and technological advancements promise to improve PD screening, diagnosis, and treatment, bringing hope to affected individuals.",1
40004464,Genomic and Transcriptomic Approaches Advance the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), represent a growing societal challenge due to their irreversible progression and significant impact on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Despite advances in clinical and imaging-based diagnostics, these diseases are often detected at advanced stages, limiting the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Recent breakthroughs in genomic and transcriptomic technologies, including whole-genome sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and CRISPR-based screens, have revolutionized the field, offering new avenues for early diagnosis and personalized prognosis. Genomic approaches have elucidated disease-specific genetic risk factors and molecular pathways, while transcriptomic studies have identified stage-specific biomarkers that correlate with disease progression and severity. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), and spatial transcriptomics are enabling the stratification of patients based on their risk profiles and prognostic trajectories. Advances in functional genomics have uncovered actionable targets, such as ATXN2 in ALS and TREM2 in AD, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies. Despite these achievements, challenges remain in translating genomic discoveries into clinical practice due to disease heterogeneity and the complexity of neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Future integration of genetic technologies holds promise for transforming diagnostic and prognostic paradigms, offering hope for improved patient outcomes and precision medicine approaches.",1
39999530,DCARD checklist: A simple screening tool for Lewy body disease-related early symptoms in memory clinic.,"Despite the relatively high prevalence of Lewy body disease (LBD) in over middle-aged people, physicians and patients show poor awareness of early symptoms. We examined the clinical utility of a simple checklist for screening for the early symptoms of LBD. We administered a 7-item screening checklist assessing the five representative early symptoms of LBD (dizziness, constipation, anosmia, REM sleep behavior disorder, and depression: the acronym is ""DCARD"") to 450 consecutive individuals who visited the memory clinic at our university hospital. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the usefulness of the DCARD checklist in differentiating neurocognitive disorders (NCD) due to LBD (i.e., NCD with Lewy bodies and NCD due to Parkinson's disease) from NCD due to non-LBD (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). We also associated the DCARD score with current depressive symptoms using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Fifty-five participants (12.2 %) had a higher DCARD score (≥4 out of 7 points) regardless of the global cognitive level. The subgroup with higher DCARD scores had higher GDS-15 scores than the subgroup with lower DCARD scores (p < 0.001). With a DCARD cut-off score of 3/4, the sensitivity and specificity were 65 % and 95 %, respectively, for diagnosing NCD due to LBDs. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed good discriminatory ability (area under the curve: 0.89). This simple LBD screening checklist may be useful as a diagnostic tool for the early diagnosis of LBD in memory clinics. None.",1
39997929,"Epigenetic Biomarkers Driven by Environmental Toxins Associated with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in the United States: A Systematic Review.","Environmental toxins and epigenetic changes have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This paper aimed to (i) identify environmental toxins associated with AD, PD, and ALS, (ii) locate potential industrial sources of toxins in the United States (U.S.), and (iii) assess epigenetic changes driven by exposure to toxins reported by patients. Environmental factors and epigenetic biomarkers of neurodegeneration were compiled from 69 studies in the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and geographic information system approaches. Some 127 environmental toxins have been associated or putatively associated with AD, PD, or ALS, with four toxic metals (As, Cd, Mn, and Hg) common to all three of these neurodegenerative diseases. Environmental toxins associated with epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) in patients include air pollutants, metals, and organic chemicals (e.g., pesticides, mycotoxins, and cyanotoxins). Geographic analysis showed that study locations (e.g., U.S., Europe, and East Asia) were selected by researchers based on convenience of access rather than exposure risk and disease prevalence. We conclude that several toxins and epigenetic markers shared among neurodegenerative diseases could serve as attractive future targets guiding environmental quality improvements and aiding in early disease detection.",1
39997692,Age-Related Changes in Caudate Glucose Metabolism: Insights from Normative Modeling Study in Healthy Subjects.,"As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia, continues to rise. Understanding the impact of aging on striatal glucose metabolism is pivotal in identifying potential biomarkers for the early detection of these disorders. We investigated age-related changes in striatal glucose metabolism using both region of interest (ROI)-based and voxel-wise correlation analyses. Additionally, we employed a normative modeling approach to establish age-related metabolic trajectories and assess individual deviations from these normative patterns. In vivo cerebral glucose metabolism was quantified using a molecular neuroimaging technique,  Our results revealed significant negative correlations between age and glucose metabolism in the bilateral caudate. Furthermore, the normative modeling demonstrated a clear, progressive decline in caudate metabolism with advancing age, and the most pronounced reductions were observed in older individuals. These findings suggest that metabolic reductions in the caudate may serve as a sensitive biomarker for normal aging and offer valuable insights into the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, by establishing age-specific reference values for caudate glucose metabolism, the normative model provides a framework for detecting deviations from expected metabolic patterns, which may facilitate the early identification of metabolic alterations that could precede clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative processes.",1
39997046,The Spectrum of Cognitive Impairment in Atypical Parkinsonism Syndromes: A Comprehensive Review of Current Understanding and Research.,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are the most common atypical parkinsonism (AP) syndromes. They are clinically characterized by varying combinations of levodopa-poorly responsive parkinsonism, motor, cerebellar, and other signs. They are associated with a wide spectrum of non-motor symptoms, including prominent cognitive impairment such as global cognitive deficits, memory, executive, attentional, visuospatial, language, and non-verbal reasoning dysfunctions. Within the APs, their cognitive functioning is distributed along a continuum from MSA with the least impaired cognitive profile (similar to Parkinson's disease) to PSP and CBD with the greatest decline in global cognitive and executive domains. Although their pathological hallmarks are different-MSA α-synucleinopathy, CBD, and PSP 4-repeat tauopathies-cognitive dysfunctions in APs show both overlaps and dissimilarities. They are often preceding and anticipate motor dysfunctions, finally contributing to reduced quality of life of patients and caregivers. The present paper will review the current evidence of the prevalence and type of cognitive impairment in these AP syndromes, their neuroimaging, pathogenic backgrounds, and current management options based on extensive literature research. Cognitive dysfunctions in APs are due to disruption of prefronto-subcortical and striato-thalamo-cortical circuitries and multiple essential brain networks. This supports the concept that they are brain network disorders due to complex pathogenic mechanisms related to the basic proteinopathies that are still poorly understood. Therefore, the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in APs deserve further elucidation as a basis for early diagnosis and adequate treatment of these debilitating comorbidities.",1
39997004,Development of Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis and Monitoring from Traditional to Digital Biomarkers.,"Monitoring and assessing the progression of symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are critical for improving patient outcomes. Traditional biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis and brain imaging, are widely used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of disease and enable early diagnosis. In contrast, digital biomarkers derived from phenotypic changes-such as EEG, eye movement, gait, and speech analysis-offer a noninvasive and accessible alternative. Leveraging portable and widely available devices, such as smartphones and wearable sensors, digital biomarkers are emerging as a promising tool for ND diagnosis and monitoring. This review highlights the comprehensive developments in digital biomarkers, emphasizing their unique advantages and integration potential alongside traditional biomarkers.",1

39990579,MicroRNA Expression in Asymptomatic Welders: Implications for Biomarker Discovery for Environmentally-Linked Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Chronic occupational exposure to metals in welding fumes has been implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression have been associated with various neurodegenerative conditions. Circulating miRNAs, in particular, have emerged as promising, minimally invasive biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression. This study was designed to characterize the expression of miRNAs in neuronally-enriched serum extracellular vesicles (EVs) among welders and non-welders to explore their potential link to metal concentrations and welding exposure measures and their potential as early diagnostic biomarkers for neurodegeneration. Serum samples from 39 welders and 27 healthy individuals were collected, and EV-enclosed miRNAs were extracted and analyzed. Also, whole blood metal concentrations and welding exposure measurements were obtained. Fifty miRNAs were found to be dysregulated in welders",1
39985630,A Multi-omics Framework Based on Machine Learning as a Predictor of Cognitive Impairment Progression in Early Parkinson's Disease.,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the diagnosis and prediction of CI progression in PD remain challenging. We aimed to explore a multi-omics framework based on machine learning integrating comprehensive radiomics, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and genetics information to identify CI progression in early PD. Patients were first diagnosed with PD without CI at baseline. According to whether CI progressed within 5 years, patients were divided into two groups: PD without CI and PD with CI. Radiomics signatures were extracted from patients' T1-weighted MRI. We used machine learning methods to construct radiomics, hybrid, and multi-omics models in the training set and validated the models in the testing set. In the two groups, we found 7, 23, and 25 radiomics signatures with significant differences in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes, respectively. The radiomics model using the 25 signatures of the frontal lobe had an accuracy of 0.833 and an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.879 to predict CI progression. In addition, the hybrid model fused with the cerebrospinal fluid Aβ level had an accuracy of 0.867 and an AUC of 0.916. In our study, the multi-omics model showed the best predictive performance. The accuracy of the multi-omics model was 0.900, and the average AUC value after five-fold cross-validation was 0.928. Radiomics signatures have a recognition effect in the CI progression in early PD. Multi-omics frameworks combining radiomics, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and genetic information may be a potential predictor of CI progression in PD.",1
39982930,Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: A reproduction and replication study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability related for instance to cohort selection or image analysis. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers to variations in the data processing workflow is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to fully reproduce (reimplementing the experiments with the same methods, including data collection from the same database) and replicate (different data and/or method) the models described in (Nguyen et al., 2021) to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in (Nguyen et al., 2021) and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Different criteria were used to evaluate the reproduction attempt and compare the results with the original ones. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 > 0), which is consistent with its findings. In addition, we performed a partial reproduction using derived data provided by the authors of the original study, and we obtained results that were close to the original ones. The challenges encountered while attempting to reproduce (fully and partially) and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.",1
39981606,Comparison of Quantitative-Electroencephalogram (q-EEG) Measurements Between Patients of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson Disease Dementia (PDD).,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are synucleinopathy syndromes with similar symptom profiles that are distinguished clinically based on the arbitrary rule of the time of symptom onset. Identifying reliable electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers would provide a precise method for better diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of treatment response in these two types of dementia. From April 2015 to March 2021, the records of new referrals to a neurology clinic were retrospectively reviewed and 28 DLB(70.3% male) and 20 PDD (80.8% male) patients with appropriate EEG were selected for this study. Artifact-free 60-s EEG signals (21 channels) at rest with eyes closed were analyzed using EEGLAB, and regional spectral power ratios were extracted. Marked diffuse slowing was found in DLB patients compared to PDD patients in all regions in terms of decrease in alpha and increase in theta band. Although, these findings demean between groups after adjusting for MMSE scores, the significant difference still remained in terms of the mean relative alpha powers, particularly in the anterior and central regions. QEEG measures may have the potential to discriminate between these two syndromes. However, further prospective and longitudinal studies are required to improve the early differentiation of these dementia syndromes and to elucidate the underlying causes and pathogenesis and specific treatment.",1

Current risk algorithms heavily rely on age, highlighting the need for alternative models with strong predictive power, especially at age 65, a crucial time for early screening and prevention. This prospective study analyzed electronic health records (EHR) from 76,427 adults (age 65, 52.1% women) using the THIN database. A general risk algorithm for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia was developed using machine learning to select predictors from diagnoses, and medications. Medications (e.g., laxatives, urological drugs, antidepressants), along with sex, BMI, and comorbidities, were key predictors. The algorithm achieved a 38.4% detection rate at a 5% false-positive rate for 2-year dementia prediction. The validated prediction algorithms, easy to implement in primary care, identify high-risk 65-year-olds using medication records. Further refinement and broader validation are needed.",1

39973512,Predictive potential of circular walking in prodromal Parkinson's disease.,"Development of objective, reliable and easy-to-use methods to detect the onset of motor changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) is required to identify the temporal window in which neuromodulatory therapies could be implemented. Turning impairments are present at early stages of PD. However, it is unclear, to date, whether circular walking is also altered in prodromal PD. Explore the predictive potential of circular walking in prodromal PD. We included 102 subjects from a nine-year prospective cohort study (with 712 participants) in the current nested case-control analysis: 16 diagnosed with PD during follow-up (incident PD) and 96 healthy controls, matched in gender, age, and education with a 1:6 ratio. Forty-one gait features were extracted from baseline assessments with accelerometers under single and dual-tasking conditions. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to test the temporal association of non-correlated gait features to the probability of being diagnosed with PD. We identified associations between time from baseline measurement to PD diagnosis for eleven gait features, mostly based on harmonic ratios, step and stride variability, and index of harmonicity, partially in combination with gait speed. Most significant associations indicated that low gait symmetry and low rhythmicity were associated with larger hazard of being diagnosed with PD. Area under the curve ranged 0.63-0.69. Despite low sensitivity and specificity, the findings potentially reflect prodromal motor impairments of PD manifested during circular walking, assessed quantitatively with a low-cost and wearable instrument. This will contribute to the characterization of pre-diagnostic PD motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive condition that affects movement. Detecting motor changes early, even before clear symptoms appear, could help identify the right time to start treatments that slow down the disease. Turning and circular walking are often affected early in PD, but it is unclear if these impairments begin before a PD diagnosis. This study looked at how people walk in circles to see if it could predict PD before diagnosis. Researchers analyzed data from 102 people in a long-term study. Sixteen of these participants developed PD during the study, and 96 healthy individuals (matched by age, gender, and education) were used as controls. We used a single wearable sensor to measure 41 walking features during simple and multi-tasking walking tests. The results showed that certain walking features like symmetry, rhythm, and stride consistency were linked to a higher likelihood of developing PD. People with less symmetrical and less rhythmic walking patterns were more likely to develop PD. However, the ability to predict PD based on these features alone was limited. In summary, this study suggests that circular walking patterns measured with low-cost wearable devices may reveal early motor impairments in PD. Although further work is needed, these findings could help improve how we identify and monitor early PD symptoms.",1
39973503,"Effects of 6 months of endurance exercise on motor function, exercise capacity, and autonomic function based on presence of autonomic dysfunction in individuals with early Parkinson's disease.","Endurance exercise improves aerobic capacity (VO We investigated whether CI in people with early PD influences the change in motor signs, VO We performed secondary analyses of the Study in Parkinson's Disease of Exercise (SPARX), which randomized people with early PD into a high-intensity endurance exercise [80-85% of peak HR], moderate-intensity endurance exercise [60-65% of peak HR], or usual care group. MDS-UDPRS Part 3 score, VO Data from 119 individuals (64.0 ± 9.0 years, 57.1% male, 0.3 years since diagnosis [median]) were analyzed. There were no differences among the groups in change in MDS-UPDRS motor score ( Baseline CI did not alter responses to endurance exercise in those with early PD, suggesting that the beneficial effects of endurance exercise on disease progression and VO Exercise training, such as walking on a treadmill, helps improve fitness and symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) in those who have recently been diagnosed with PD. We aimed to determine if these beneficial effects of exercise were also experienced by those with PD who may have a hard time increasing their heart rate during an exercise test. This study looked at the effects of different intensities of 6 months of treadmill exercise and the ability to get one's heart rate up to where one might expect based on age during exercise testing on motor symptoms of PD and exercise capacity. Regardless of one's ability to increase their heart rate to an expected value based on age, individuals with early PD experienced benefits from 6 months of treadmill exercise training. This suggests that the beneficial effects of exercise training on disease progression and exercise capacity in early PD apply equally to those with normal or abnormal heart rate responses to exercise testing.",1
39973492,SynNeurGe: The road ahead for a biological definition of Parkinson's disease.,"While significant progress has been made in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have consistently failed. To address the underlying molecular mechanisms of PD, two biology-based criteria have been proposed: the ""Synucleinopathy-Neurodegeneration-Genetics"" (SynNeurGe) and ""neuronal α-synuclein disease"" (NSD) frameworks. Both frameworks emphasize the importance of biological markers over clinical symptoms. They recognize α-synuclein aggregation and genetic mutations (such as SNCA) as key diagnostic elements, with α-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) used to detect early disease stages. Dopaminergic neurodegeneration, measured by DAT imaging, is also central to both frameworks. These shared features aim to improve early diagnosis and precision medicine for PD. However, SynNeurGe provides a broader, more flexible framework that integrates α-synuclein pathology (S), neurodegeneration (N), and genetics (G), linked to clinical features (C). It aims to accommodate the complexity of PD and related Lewy body diseases, facilitating research on targeted DMTs. In contrast, NSD focuses specifically on PD and Lewy body dementia, introducing a staging system (NSD-ISS) based on biological markers and clinical impairment, helping track disease progression from preclinical to symptomatic stages. Despite their differences, both approaches highlight the need for more specific biomarkers and prospective studies to improve early intervention and personalized treatment. Harmonizing SynNeurGe and NSD concepts will be key in creating a universally accepted framework for precise PD diagnosis and therapy development. In recent years, significant progress has been made in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, but therapies to slow or stop disease progression have failed. Symptomatic treatments focus on neurotransmitter replacement, while disease-modifying therapies target the molecular and cellular causes of PD. Two research criteria aim to redefine PD biologically, not just by clinical symptoms. The SynNeurGe and NSD concepts both focus on the role of α-synuclein, a protein linked to PD, but differ slightly in approach.SynNeurGeThis framework highlights three key elements—pathological α-synuclein in bodily fluids, evidence of neurodegeneration, and specific gene mutations. These are linked to clinical features, aiming to support targeted research for precision medicine.NSD (Neuronal α-synuclein disease)This approach identifies PD and related diseases by detecting α-synuclein aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid and dopaminergic neurodegeneration using dopamine transporter imaging. It also introduces a staging system, from pre-symptomatic to more advanced stages, based on biological markers and clinical symptoms. Both models share common ground in using α-synuclein detection, demonstration of neurodegeneration, and genetic mutations to define PD biologically. NSD proposes a more restricted concept, which fits within the broader SynNeurGe framework. Further research is needed to track how these biological markers evolve over time, with a focus on finding more precise biomarkers and affordable diagnostic tools. Harmonizing these two concepts could lead to earlier diagnoses, more accurate staging, and personalized treatment plans for PD.",1
39973484,New insights from a Malaysian real-world deep brain stimulation cohort.,"The availability of deep brain stimulation (DBS), a highly efficacious treatment for several movement disorders, remains low in developing countries, with scarce data available on utilization and outcomes. We characterized the DBS cohort and outcomes at a Malaysian quaternary medical center. A retrospective chart review was done on DBS-related surgery at the University of Malaya, including clinico-demographic, genetics, and outcomes data focusing on post-operative medication reduction and complications. 149 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients underwent DBS targeting the subthalamic nucleus. Six had globus pallidus internus DBS (primarily for dystonia). Only 16.1% of patients were government-funded. Of the 133 PD patients operated in the past decade (2013-2022), 25 (18.8%) had disease duration <5 years. At 6-12 months post-DBS, median levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD) reduction was 440.5 [418.9] mg/day, corresponding to a reduction of ≥50% and ≥30% in 42.2% and 69.8% of patients, respectively.

Here, we describe a relatively large cohort of patients who underwent DBS at a major hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. DBS was effective with low complication rates, and at 6-12 months after surgery, the PD medication dosage was reduced by at least one-half in 4 out of 10 patients and by at least one-third in 7 out of 10 patients. Patients with PD who underwent DBS early in their disease course (within 5 years from diagnosis, comprising one-fifth of the patients), and those diagnosed at age 50 years or younger (comprising one-half of the patients), appeared to have larger reductions in their PD medications.

Our aim was to analyze the frequency of dysphagia in patients with early PD comparing with a control group and to identify related factors. Patients with early PD (≤ 2 years from symptoms onset) who were recruited from January/2016 to November/2017 (baseline visit; V0) and evaluated annually for 5 years from the Spanish cohort COPPADIS were included in this prospective study. Controls were assessed at baseline and at 2-, 4-, and 5-year follow-up. Dysphagia was defined as a score ≥ 1 in the item 20 of the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Dysphagia was more frequent at baseline in PD patients (19.6% [36/184]; 62.3 ± 8.3 years old; 56.8% males) than in controls (5.3% [11/206]; 60.9 ± 8.3 years old; 50% males) (p < 0.0001) and in all visits as well (p < 0.0001).

In those subjects with dysphagia, no differences were observed between patients and controls in the mean NMSS-item 20 overtime, and it didn´t change throughout the follow-up. Dysphagia was frequent in early PD patients compared to controls. However, it was minor and did not progress over time. Sleep, ICB, and non-motor symptoms burden were related to dysphagia.",1

Early and objective detection of postural impairments is crucial to facilitate interventions. Our aim was to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate people with early to mid-stage PD from healthy age-matched individuals based on spectrogram images obtained from their body sway. We hypothesized the time-frequency content of body sway to be predictive of PD, even when impairments are not yet clinically apparent. 18 people with idiopathic PD and 15 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. We tracked participants' center of pressure (COP) using a Wii Balance Board and their full-body motion using a Microsoft Kinect, out of which we calculated the trajectory of their center of mass (COM). We used 30 s-snippets of motion data from which we acquired wavelet-based time-frequency spectrograms that were fed into a custom-built CNN as labeled images. We used binary classification to have the network differentiate between individuals with PD and controls (n = 15, respectively). Classification performance was best when the medio-lateral motion of the COM was considered. Here, our network reached a predictive accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1-score of 100%, respectively, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 1.0. Moreover, an explainable AI approach revealed high frequencies in the postural sway data to be most distinct between both groups. Heeding our small and heterogeneous sample, our findings suggest a CNN classifier based on cost-effective and conveniently obtainable posturographic data to be a promising approach to detect postural impairments in early to mid-stage PD and to gain novel insight into the subtle characteristics of impairments at this stage of the disease.",1

39961960,Efficient Neural Network Classification of Parkinson's Disease and Schizophrenia Using Resting-State EEG Data.,"Timely identification of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia is crucial for the effective management and enhancement of patients' quality of life. The utilization of electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring applications has proven instrumental in diagnosing various brain disorders. Prior research has predominantly relied on predefined knowledge of physiological alterations associated with different diseases, employing feature extraction to discern brain conditions. This study introduces SwiftBrainNet, a neural network designed for the classification of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia using short resting-state EEG segments. SwiftBrainNet aims to minimize reliance on manual feature extraction, relying solely on short EEG segments. Functioning as a single-input, dual-output neural network, SwiftBrainNet incorporates a deep supervisory mechanism facilitated by an auxiliary decoder, which enhances its classification performance by guiding the network in extracting shallow features. Our study conducts a clinical application-oriented experiment that uses continuous multi-segment EEG voting classification. This experiment demonstrates a noticeable improvement in accuracy compared to leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), especially when combined with our data augmentation techniques. These findings underscore the method's practical value in clinical settings, where continuous data frames and enhanced generalization across subjects can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, the high accuracy observed in subject-dependent classification with very short data segments suggests that SwiftBrainNet might capture subject-specific EEG patterns, which could be further explored to enhance disease-related feature learning. This paper provides new evidence supporting the use of short-term EEG data for neurodiagnostic applications, making SwiftBrainNet a promising tool for the early detection of neurological disorders.",1
39957801,Individualized diagnosis of Parkinson's disease based on multivariate magnetic resonance imaging radiomics and clinical indexes.,"To explore MRI-based radiomics models, integrating clinical characteristics, for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) to evaluate their diagnostic performance. A total of 256 participants [153 PD, 103 healthy controls (HCs)] from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical Hospital, were enrolled as the training set, and 120 subjects (74 PD, 46 HCs) from the PPMI dataset served as the test set. Radiomics features were extracted from structural MRI (T1WI and T2-FLair). Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were developed using MRI radiomics data from both monomodal and multimodal radiomics models. The clinical-radiomics model was constructed by integrating clinical variables, including UPDRS, Hoehn-Yahr stage, age, sex, and MMSE scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the performance of the models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to access the clinical usefulness of the models. In the training set, the T2-FLair and T1WI radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.896 (95% CI, 0.812-0.900) and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.818-0.908), respectively. The double-sequence radiomics model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.965 (95% CI, 0.885-0.978) in the training set and an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI, 0.748-0.910) in the test set. The integrated clinical-radiomics model showed enhanced diagnostic accuracy, with AUC = 0.983 (95% CI, 0.897-0.996) in the training set and AUC = 0.837 (95% CI, 0.786-0.902) in the test set. Rad-scores derived from the radiomics model were significantly correlated with diagnostic outcomes ( The integrated clinical-radiomics model offered superior diagnostic performance compared to models based relying solely on imaging or clinical data, underscoring its potential as a non-invasive and effective tool in routine clinical practice for the early diagnosis of PD.",1
39957189,Increasing trends in utilization of physical and occupational therapy services in early Parkinson's disease.,"Best practice guidelines in Parkinson's disease (PD) calls for the immediate initiation of rehabilitation therapies (inclusive of physical (PT) and occupational therapy (OT)) to prevent or ameliorate the loss of function and quality of life associated with disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the utilization of PT and OT services within the first 2 years following PD diagnosis and to observe longitudinal trends in PT and OT utilization early following PD diagnosis. This retrospective cohort study accessed 12 years (2011 to 2023) of data from electronic health records at a midwestern US healthy system. Patients with new PD diagnoses and two-years of visit history were included. The primary outcome was utilization of PT or OT services within two-years of PD diagnosis. Data extracted included demographics and PD therapies. Records of 9720 patients were included in the analyses. Overall, 36.9% of the cohort ( This study shows a promising increase in utilization of PT and OT services over previous reports and longitudinally, however it continues to convey how far clinical practice continues to lag behind best practice and scientific recommendation. This study looked at how often people with Parkinson's disease (PD) use physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) in the first two years after being diagnosed. These therapies are important because they can help maintain a person's ability to function and improve their quality of life as the disease progresses. The researchers analyzed data from 9720 patients diagnosed with PD between 2011 and 2023. They wanted to see how many of these patients received PT or OT within two years of their diagnosis and to track how the use of these therapies changed over time. The study found that only about 37% of patients received PT or OT within the first two years of their PD diagnosis. Certain groups of people were more likely to use these therapies, including older adults, women, African Americans, those with other health conditions, and those taking medication to manage PD symptoms. Over time, the use of PT and OT increased slightly each year by about 1.4% between 2013 and 2021. The findings suggest that while more people are using PT and OT after a PD diagnosis than in the past, many still aren’t receiving these important therapies as recommended. This highlights a gap between what is considered best practice and what is actually happening in clinical care. More efforts may be needed to ensure that all people with PD have access to the therapies that can help them live better with the disease.",1
39957188,Chronic urinary tract infections cause persistent microglial changes in a humanized ɑ-synuclein mouse model.,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) have recently been linked to the onset of multiple synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). UTIs are more common in people with PD or MSA, than in the general population and within these patient groups the incidence of UTIs is evenly distributed between men and women. UTIs are especially common during disease, but also in the years before clinical diagnosis. The mechanisms by which UTIs may contribute to the development and progression of PD or MSA are not well understood. In this work, we evaluate the neuroinflammatory effects of recurrent UTIs on the brain. In a humanized mouse model of ɑ-synuclein, we find that repeated administration of uropathogenic  Recurrent UTIs lead to behavioral motor changes and are accompanied by persistent neuroinflammatory changes in multiple brain areas. Affected regions with microglial changes involve multiple lower brainstem areas responsible for sickness behavior, including the dorsal vagal complex, and the cingulate cortex. These results suggests that recurrent UTIs can have lasting impact on the brain, and it warrants further investigation of the potential role of UTIs in the disease progression of synucleinopathies and related neurological disorders. This study explores how repeated urinary tract infections (UTIs) might influence the brain and contribute to the development of diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). UTIs are common, especially in older adults and people with these neurodegenerative diseases, and they can worsen symptoms.A novel mouse model is established by repeatedly infecting mice with a type of bacteria known to cause UTIs in humans. We find that repeated infections lead to persistent UTIs and, more importantly, causes long-term inflammation in the brain. The areas of the brain affected by this inflammation are known to be involved in movement, pain regulation and sickness behavior.The findings suggest that chronic UTIs may not only be a symptom of PD and MSA but that they could also contribute to the progression of these diseases by causing ongoing brain inflammation. This inflammation might make the brain more vulnerable to further damage. Better understanding of these mechanisms could lead to new strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of these neurodegenerative diseases. The study highlights the need for more research to determine how managing UTIs could potentially protect the brain and improve outcomes for people at risk of or living with PD and MSA.",1
39952991,Early detection of Parkinson's disease using a multi area graph convolutional network.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder, and early diagnosis is crucial for the treatment and quality of life of patients. Gait movement disorder is a significant manifestation of PD, and automated gait assessment is key to achieving automated detection of PD patients. With the development of deep learning, in order to improve the accuracy of early Parkinson's disease detection and enhance the robustness of motion recognition models, this study introduces an innovative deep learning approach, namely Multi-area Attention Spatiotemporal Directed Graph Convolutional Network (Ma-ST-DGN). The model effectively captures temporal and spatial information from the movement data of subjects to better understand subtle movement abnormalities in patients. Simultaneously, by reconstructing human skeleton features using directed graphs and introducing a multi-area self-attention mechanism, the model can adaptively focus on key information in different areas and apply more effective fusion strategies on features from different areas, thereby increasing sensitivity to potential signs of Parkinson's disease. By more effectively integrating global and local area information, the model captures subtle manifestations of PD. We use the first Parkinson's disease gait dataset, PD-Walk, consisting of walking videos of 95 PD patients and 96 healthy individuals. Extensive experiments on this clinical video dataset demonstrate that the model achieves the best performance to date, with an accuracy of 88.7%, far superior to existing sensor and vision-based Parkinson's gait assessment methods. Therefore, the method proposed in this study may be effective for early diagnosis of PD in clinical practice.",1
39952778,Association of early-onset psychiatric disorders with REM sleep behavior disorder - A retrospective study.,"REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a known predictor of the subsequent development of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease and other alpha synucleinopathies. RBD has also been found to be common among children with other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD. This retrospective study aims to analyze the prevalence of early-onset psychiatric disorders among patients referred for RBD to our sleep laboratory. Our hypothesis is that early-onset psychiatric disorders are more common in patients with polysomnographically confirmed RBD. A retrospective chart review was performed through the Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC) Sleep Laboratory. Data collection involved gathering information regarding the patient's sleep study, psychiatric diagnoses and/or symptoms, mental health medication history and any neurodegenerative conditions noted in hospital clinical notes. Patients referred for and polysomnographically confirmed RBD were more likely to have presented with symptoms, or received a clinical diagnosis, of an early-onset psychiatric disorder at 32 % compared to the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) control group at 3 %. History of early-onset psychiatric disorders is more common among patients referred as RBD compared to a control group of patients with OSA. Future studies are required to confirm the validity and replicability of this finding.",1
39945257,Parkinson's Disease: From Bench to Bedside-Advancements in Diagnosis and Therapeutics using Pharmacogenomic Approach.,"This article provides a detailed look at Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative ailment mostly known for movement difficulties such tremor, stiffness, and bradykinesia, which affects approximately 1% of persons over the age of 60. Although the precise cause of PD is still unknown, various factors such as pesticide exposure, genetics, and lifestyle choices like smoking and caffeine consumption are thought to play a role in its development. The presence of Lewy bodies characterizes the disease, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and disruptions in basal ganglia circuitry, resulting in both motor and nonmotor symptoms. This review is structured into several key sections, beginning with an exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms behind PD, including how genetic mutations can lead to deficits in the Ubiquitin Proteasome System and mitochondrial function, which are linked to familial cases of the disease. Following this, the article explores diagnostic methods, such as the UK Brain Bank Criteria, advanced imaging techniques, olfactory testing, and innovative technologies like machine learning, all of which support early detection and accurate diagnosis of PD. Treatment strategies are also comprehensively reviewed, focusing on traditional pharmacological options like levodopa and dopamine agonists, as well as surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation. Additionally, the review discusses promising new therapies, including immunotherapy aimed at neuroinflammation and gene therapy for disease modification. The impact of lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet on reducing PD risk and enhancing symptom management are also considered. In conclusion, this review highlights the complex nature of Parkinson's disease and underscores the need for a holistic approach that combines pharmacotherapy, advanced treatments, and lifestyle adjustments. By addressing both symptom management and disease modification, these strategies provide hope for improving quality of life.",1

39937650,Combined genomics and proteomics unveils elusive variants and vast aetiologic heterogeneity in dystonia.,"Dystonia is a rare-disease trait for which large-scale genomic investigations are still underrepresented. Genetic heterogeneity among patients with unexplained dystonia warrants interrogation of entire genome sequences, but this has not yet been systematically evaluated. To significantly enhance our understanding of the genetic contribution to dystonia, we (re)analyzed 2,874 whole-exome sequencing (WES), 564 whole-genome sequencing (WGS), as well as 80 fibroblast-derived proteomics datasets, representing the output of high-throughput analyses in 1,990 patients and 973 unaffected relatives from 1,877 families. Recruitment and precision-phenotyping procedures were driven by long-term collaborations of international experts with access to overlooked populations. By exploring WES data, we found that continuous scaling of sample sizes resulted in steady gains in the number of associated disease genes without plateauing. On average, every second diagnosis involved a gene not previously implicated in our cohort. Second-line WGS focused on a subcohort of undiagnosed individuals with high likelihood of having monogenic forms of dystonia, comprising large proportions of patients with early onset (81.3%), generalized symptom distribution (50.8%) and/or coexisting features (68.9%). We undertook extensive searches for variants in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to uncover 38 (ultra)rare diagnostic-grade findings in 37 of 305 index patients (12.1%), many of which had remained undetected due to methodological inferiority of WES or pipeline limitations. WGS-identified elusive variations included alterations in exons poorly covered by WES, RNA-gene variants, mitochondrial-DNA mutations, small copy-number variants, complex rearranged genome structure, and short tandem repeats. For improved variant interpretation in WGS-inconclusive cases, we employed systematic integration of quantitative proteomics. This aided in verifying diagnoses related to technically challenging variants and in upgrading a variant of uncertain significance (3 of 70 WGS-inconclusive index patients, 4.3%). Further, unsupervised proteomic outlier-analysis supplemented with transcriptome sequencing revealed pathological gene underexpression induced by transcript disruptions in three more index patients with underlying (deep) intronic variants (3/70, 4.3%), highlighting the potential for targeted antisense-oligonucleotide therapy development. Finally, trio-WGS prioritized a de-novo missense change in the candidate PRMT1, encoding a histone-methyltransferase. Data-sharing strategies supported the discovery of three distinct PRMT1 de-novo variants in four phenotypically similar patients, associated with loss-of-function effects in in-vitro assays. This work underscores the importance of continually expanding sequencing cohorts to characterize the extensive spectrum of gene aberrations in dystonia. We show that a pool of unresolved cases is amenable to WGS and complementary multi-omic studies, directing advanced etiopathological concepts and future diagnostic-practice workflows for dystonia.",1
39932809,Exploring the role of synaptic plasticity in the frequency-dependent complexity domain.,"The involvement of the neocortex in memory processes depends on neuronal plasticity, the ability to restructure inter-neuronal connections, which is essential for learning and long-term memory. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for advancing early diagnosis and treatment of cognitive disorders such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. This study explores a neuronal model with expanded populations, using information-theoretic cues to uncover dynamics underlying plasticity. By employing Bandt-Pompe's entropy-complexity (H×C) and Fisher entropy-information (H×F) planes, hidden patterns in neuronal activity are revealed. These methodologies are particularly suitable for analyzing nonlinear dynamics and causal relationships in time series. In addition, the Hénon map is applied to capture nonlinear behaviors, such as neural firing, highlighting the trade-off between stability and unpredictability in neural networks. Our approach integrates local field potential and intracranial electroencephalograms' data in multiple frequency bands, connecting computational models with experimental evidence. By addressing higher-order interactions, such as action potential triplets, this work advances the understanding of synaptic adjustments and their implications for neuronal complexity and cognitive disorders.",1
39922654,A robust method for parkinson's disease diagnosis: Combining electroencephalography signal features with reconstructed phase space images.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease. Since the diagnosis of the PD is mainly made based on the symptoms and after the disease progression, early diagnosis can play a crucial role in delaying the passage of the PD. There have been many methods focusing on disease diagnosis using electroencephalography (EEG) signals, where most of the proposed methods are data-dependent. Here, the study aims to propose a technique that, despite its high accuracy, is robust. Various features including fractal dimension, approximate entropy, largest Lyapunov exponent, and the energy of different frequency sub-bands were extracted from EEG signals. Multi-layer perceptron neural networks were used for classification based on these features. Additionally, 2D phase space images reconstructed from EEG signals were classified using convolutional neural networks. Finally, a combination of these features and images was used for classification using ResNets. During 10 rounds of training and testing, the mean accuracies were calculated for three cases: using only features, only images, and a combination of both. The mean accuracies were 84.67 %, 76.5 %, and 90.2 % respectively. The variances for each case were 35.6 %, 19.5 %, and 13.97 %. The lower variance when using a combination of features and images indicates a more accurate and robust classification.",1
39920821,β-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid as a potential biomarker for distinguishing human prion diseases from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"β-synuclein (β-syn), mainly expressed in central nerve system, is one of the biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood for synaptic damage, which has been reported to be elevated in CSF and blood of the patients of prion diseases (PrDs). We analyzed 314 CSF samples from patients in China National Surveillance for CJD. The diagnostic groups of the 223 patients with PrDs included sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (sCJD), genetic CJD (gCJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS). 91 patients with non-PrDs comprised Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), viral encephalitis (VE) or autoimmune encephalitis (AE) were enrolled in the control groups. The CSF β-syn levels were measured by a commercial microfluidic ELISA. The Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis H test were employed to analyze two or more sets of continuous variables. Multiple linear regression was also performed to evaluate the factors for CSF β-syn levels. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were used to assess the diagnostic performance of β-syn. The median of β-syn levels (2074 pg/ml; IQR: 691 to 4332) of all PrDs was significantly higher than that of non-PrDs group (504 pg/ml; IQR: 126 to 3374). The CSF β-syn values in the cohorts of sCJD, T188K-gCJD, E200K-gCJD and P102L-GSS were remarkably higher than that of the group of AD + PD, but similar as that of the group of VE + AE. The elevated CSF β-syn in sCJD and gCJD cases was statistically associated with CSF 14-3-3 positive and appearance of mutism. ROC curve analysis identified satisfied performance for distinguishing from AD + PD, with high AUC values in sCJD (0.7640), T188K-gCJD (0.8489), E200K-gCJD (0.8548), P102L-GSS (0.7689) and D178N-FFI (0.7210), respectively. Our data here indicate that CSF β-syn is a potential biomarker for distinguishing PrDs (gCJD, sCJD and GSS) from AD and PD, but is much less efficient from VE and AE. These findings have critical implications for early diagnosis and monitoring of synaptic integrity in prion diseases.",1
39920796,Refining α-synuclein seed amplification assays to distinguish Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are two distinct α-synucleinopathies traditionally differentiated through clinical symptoms. Early diagnosis of MSA is problematic, and seed amplification assays (SAAs), such as real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), offer the potential to distinguish these diseases through their underlying α-synuclein (α-Syn) pathology and proteoforms. Currently, SAAs provide a binary result, signifying either the presence or absence of α-Syn seeds. To enhance the diagnostic potential and biological relevance of these assays, there is a pressing need to incorporate quantification and stratification of α-Syn proteoform-specific aggregation kinetics into current SAA pipelines. Optimal RT-QuIC assay conditions for α-Syn seeds extracted from PD and MSA patient brains were determined, and assay kinetics were assessed for α-Syn seeds from different pathologically relevant brain regions (medulla, substantia nigra, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, and cerebellum). The conformational profiles of disease- and region-specific α-Syn proteoforms were determined by subjecting the amplified reaction products to concentration-dependent proteolytic digestion with proteinase K. Using our protocol, PD and MSA could be accurately delineated using proteoform-specific aggregation kinetics, including α-Syn aggregation rate, maximum relative fluorescence, the gradient of amplification, and core protofilament size. MSA cases yielded significantly higher values than PD cases across all four kinetic parameters in brain tissues, with the MSA-cerebellar phenotype having higher maximum relative fluorescence than the MSA-Parkinsonian phenotype. Statistical significance was maintained when the data were analysed regionally and when all regions were grouped. Our RT-QuIC protocol and analysis pipeline can distinguish between PD and MSA, and between MSA phenotypes. MSA α-Syn seeds induce faster propagation and exhibit higher aggregation kinetics than PD α-Syn, mirroring the biological differences observed in brain tissue. With further validation of these quantitative parameters, we propose that SAAs could advance from a yes/no diagnostic to a theranostic biomarker that could be utilised in developing therapeutics.",1
39918711,Exosomes in Regulating miRNAs for Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Exosomal proteins and miRNAs, including α-synuclein, Aβ, tau, CXCL12, miR-24, and miR-23b-3p, are emerging as valuable biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and prenatal diagnostics, with significant potential for personalized therapies. Advances in MRI and chitosan-based drug delivery systems are creating new opportunities for diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative disorders. Exosomes regulate miRNAs and proteins, presenting theranostic potential for Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, yet facing delivery and targeting challenges. Exosomal miRNAs, such as miR-1234, miR-5678, and miR-29a, are crucial for the early detection and monitoring of the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, novel biomarkers such as SCA27B and FGF14 gene mutations and serum miR-455-3p offer promising noninvasive diagnostic methods for Alzheimer's disease. The expanding role of exosome-derived miRNAs in targeting oncogenes and regulating the cell cycle enhances therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders, opening doors to more personalized and effective disease management.",1

To determine the prevalence and predictors of PD in a large international 22q11.2DS sample. The sample comprised 856 adults (median age 28 (range 16-76) years; 53.0% female). PD was defined as clinical diagnosis by a neurologist (including bradykinesia, rest tremor and/or rigidity). Age-specific risk and predictors of PD were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression. PD was present in 1.8% (95% CI: 0.9-2.6%) of the sample, 3.4% (95% CI: 2.2-4.6%) when including uncertain PD (clinical diagnosis or suspicion, but not meeting all criteria), and 14.0% (95% CI: 6.9-21.0%) of those aged ≥50 years. Median age at motor onset was 45 (range 20-66) years. None of the factors considered were associated with PD. Given high PD prevalence and young onset, we propose periodic motor evaluations from age 40 years in 22q11.2DS.",1
39914266,"Ten years preceding a diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease in Europe and Australia: medication use, health conditions, and biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Many studies have investigated early predictors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, evidence is sparse regarding specific and common predictors for these diseases. We aimed to identify medication use, health conditions, and blood biomarkers that might be associated with the risk of AD, PD, and ALS ten years later. We conducted population-based nested case-control studies of AD, PD, and ALS using electronic medical records in Europe (France, the UK, and Sweden) and Australia. We retrieved data on medication use, diagnosed health conditions, and measured blood biomarkers from electronic medical records or biomedical cohorts. Conditional logistic regression models and meta-analysis were applied to assess the associations between these factors and the risk of receiving a diagnosis of AD, PD, or ALS. We included a total of 149,642 AD cases (mean age: 79.1-81.2 years), 252,696 PD cases (73.2-75.9 years), and 27,533 ALS cases (64.4-69.6 years). The prescription of psychoanaleptics and nasal preparations was consistently associated with an increased risk of AD, PD, and ALS 5-10 years later. Constipation and use of related medications were associated with an increased risk of AD and PD, while diabetes and use of antidiabetics were associated with a reduced risk of ALS. A higher level of triglycerides was associated with a lower risk of AD, whereas a higher level of Apolipoprotein B was associated with a lower risk of PD, 5-10 years later. Psychoanaleptics and nasal preparations may serve as common predictors for diagnosis of AD, PD, and ALS 5-10 years later. Conversely, the increased prevalence of constipation is specific to AD and PD, while the decreased prevalence of diabetes and use of antidiabetics is specific to ALS.

The findings from the scoping review will be presented descriptively and summarized according to the research questions to illustrate the current status of translational research on PRS in common neurodegenerative diseases.",1
39907186,Molecular Rotors Detect the Formation and Conversion of α-Synuclein Oligomers.,"α-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein that forms amyloids in Parkinson's disease. Currently, detection methods predominantly report on the formation of mature amyloids but are weakly sensitive to the early stage, toxic oligomers. Molecular rotors are fluorophores that sense changes in the viscosity of their local environment. Here, we monitor α-synuclein oligomer formation using the fluorescence lifetime of molecular rotors. We detect oligomer formation and conversion into amyloids for wild-type and two α-synuclein variants, the pathological mutant A30P and ΔP1 α-synuclein, which lacks a master regulator region of aggregation (residues 36-42). We report that A30P α-synuclein shows a rate of oligomer formation similar to that of wild-type α-synuclein, whereas ΔP1 α-synuclein shows delayed oligomer formation. Additionally, both variants demonstrate a slower conversion of oligomers into amyloids. Our method provides a quantitative approach to unveiling the complex mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation, which is key to understanding the pathology of Parkinson's disease.",1

Despite increasing research on sleep disorders in PD, a comprehensive analysis of the knowledge structure and key issues in this field are still lacking. This study aims to identify research hotspots and emerging trends related to sleep disorders in PD through a detailed bibliometric analysis. On October 1, 2024, an extensive search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database to gather relevant literature on sleep disorders in PD. Bibliometric and knowledge mapping analyses were performed using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and bibliometrix.

39894249,Emerging non-invasive MRI techniques for glymphatic system assessment in neurodegenerative disease.,"The discovery of the glymphatic system has revolutionized our understanding of brain physiology, particularly in waste clearance and fluid dynamics within the central nervous system. This pathway, essential for nutrient distribution and waste removal, operates predominantly during sleep and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Recent advances in non-invasive MRI techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), perivascular space (PVS) analysis, and free water (FW) indices, have improved our ability to study glymphatic function and its alterations in disease states. This review discusses the glymphatic system's ultrastructure, physiology, and the latest imaging methods to assess this critical pathway. We highlight how these non-invasive MRI techniques can enhance the understanding of glymphatic function in health and disease, with a focus on neurodegenerative conditions. By integrating insights from current research, this review underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of glymphatic dysfunction. Understanding these mechanisms can pave the way for novel strategies to enhance waste clearance and improve neurological health, offering potential benefits for early diagnosis and intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",1
39894010,Segment anything model-based segmentation with inception-ResNet-v2 classifier for Parkinson's disease diagnosis and metaverse visualization.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition that distresses brain cells and can severely impact a person's healthy life. Accurate diagnosis of PD is vital for early intervention. However, many existing works commonly use Voxel-Based Morphometry for brain analysis, which requires rigid preprocessing steps such as spatial normalization and template alignment that introduce biases and limit flexibility in segmenting complex or irregular brain structures. The study aims to improve PD prediction by addressing the limitation of the VBM technique by introducing the advanced automated segmentation method Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enable more accurate and reliable diagnosis. Additionally, the study presents a metaverse framework to provide a better understanding and decision-making in PD diagnosis. The proposed model employs advanced pre-processing procedures such as denoising, brain part separation, motion correction, and data augmentation to improve the brain 3D MRI image quality. The filtered images are then segmented using the SAM model. Features are extracted from segmented images using linear binary patterns, Gray-level co-occurrence motion, and shape features to enhance the robustness of PD classification. We use the Success History Intelligent Optimizer algorithm to hand-pick the optimal features for better diagnosis to avoid the local minima. The selected structures are classified with Inception-ResNet-v2 to fix the presence of PD. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance across various performance metrics for PD diagnosis. The proposed method accomplishes an accuracy of 99.75 % in predicting PD, highlighting its performance in accurately classifying PD and leading to improved patient outcomes.",1

We conducted deep learning utilizing an NN to differentiate between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the parkinsonian variant (MSA-P) of multiple system atrophy (MSA). The distinction between PD and MSA-P in the early stages presents significant challenges. Considering the recently reported heterogeneity and random distribution of lesions in MSA, we performed an analysis employing an NN with voxel-based morphometry data from the entire brain as input variables. The NN's accuracy in distinguishing MSA-P from PD demonstrates sufficient practicality for clinical application.",1
39893775,Acoustic prosodic parameters associated with Parkinson's disease cognitive impairment.,"Acoustic prosodic analysis is a novel approach that can be used to identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesize that acoustic analysis can also differentiate cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated acoustic parameters in 90 subjects including 30 PD with normal cognition (PD-NC), 30 PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 30 PD with dementia (PDD). The reading task ""Supermarket Passage"" and the picture description task ""Cookie Theft"" were used. Feature selection and modelling were then performed to systematically evaluate the importance and clinical implications of the acoustic parameters in identifying PD with cognitive impairment. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and mediation analysis revealed that acoustic parameters were independently associated with cognitive impairment including PDD and PD-MCI. These Acoustic parameters enabled the detection of PD with cognitive impairment with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.826. Compared with PD-NC, speech rate, pre-verb pause (≥1s), between-utterance pause (≥2s) in the ""Cookie Theft"" task were the two key cognitive impairment detection factors, which were frequently identified by LASSO model in both PDD and PD-MCI. F We demonstrated that acoustic parameters are useful in differentiating PD patients with cognitive impairment from patients with normal cognition after adjusting variables such as age, which was also a significant contributor to cognitive decline. Acoustic parameters may be valuable for automated screening the risk of cognitive decline in PD patients. It deserves further investigation.",1
39893139,"Use of lecanemab and donanemab in the Canadian healthcare system: Evidence, challenges, and areas for future research.","Lecanemab and donanemab are monoclonal antibody therapies that remove amyloid-beta from the brain. They are the first therapies that alter a fundamental mechanism, amyloid-beta deposition, in Alzheimer disease (AD). To inform Canadian decisions on approval and use of these drugs, the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging commissioned Work Groups to review evidence on the efficacy and safety of these new therapies, as well as their projected impacts on Canadian dementia systems of care. We included persons with lived experience with Alzheimer disease in the discussion about the benefits and harms. Our review of the trial publications found high quality evidence of statistically significant group differences, but also recognized that there are mixed views on the clinical relevance of the observed differences and the value of therapy for individual patients. The drugs are intended for persons with early AD, at a stage of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. If patients are treated, then confirmation of AD by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid analysis and monitoring for risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities was recommended, as done in the clinical trials, although it would strain Canadian resource capacity. More data are needed to determine the size of the potentially eligible treatment population in Canada.",1
39891751,Dopaminergic responsiveness and dopaminergic challenge tests of Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The assessment and quantification of dopaminergic responsiveness are crucial for the diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to summarize and compare motor improvements in patients with PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) across three types of dopaminergic challenge tests, as well as evaluate their diagnostic performance. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched to identify eligible studies reporting the improvement rate of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS-III) or MDS-UPDRS-III in dopaminergic challenge tests for PD or APS, or diagnostic outcomes in differential diagnosis between PD and APS. A random-effects model was conducted to pool improvement rates and standardized mean differences (SMDs) in patients with PD or APS during dopaminergic challenge tests. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. A bivariate mixed-effects model was employed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these tests. A total of 58 studies (3641 PD and 711 APS) were included. In the acute levodopa challenge test, patients with PD, APS, and multiple system atrophy (MSA) demonstrated pooled UPDRS-III improvement rates of 41.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 38.5%-44.5%; I The overall dopaminergic responsiveness is greater in PD patients compared to those with APS. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the pooled motor improvement of dopaminergic responsiveness within PD or APS, with overlap between de novo PD and early-stage APS. All three types of dopaminergic challenge tests demonstrate moderate diagnostic performance in differentiating PD from APS.",1
39888421,Imaging biomarkers of cortical neurodegeneration underlying cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.,"Imaging biomarkers bear great promise for improving the diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the ability of three commonly used neuroimaging modalities to detect cortical changes in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD). 53 cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN), 32 PD-MCI, and 35 PDD underwent concurrent structural MRI (sMRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), and [ In sMRI, atrophy of temporal and posterior-parietal areas allowed separating PDD from PD-CN (AUC = 0.77 ± 0.07), but diagnostic accuracy was poor for separating PD-MCI from PD-CN (0.57 ± 0.10). dMRI showed most pronounced diffusivity changes in the medial temporal lobe, which provided excellent diagnostic performance for PDD (AUC = 0.87 ± 0.06), and a more modest but still significant performance for PD-MCI (AUC = 0.71 ± 0.09). Finally, [ Among the tested modalities, [",1
39888130,Optic Disc Pallor in Parkinson's Disease: A UK Biobank Study.,"Recent studies have suggested that retinal changes measured with optical coherence tomography are detectable in early Parkinson's disease (PD), highlighting the potential of ophthalmic biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring. We set out to investigate the relationship between optic disc pallor measured in fundoscopy images and both prevalent and incident PD. We analyzed color fundus photographs from 787 UK Biobank participants: 89 with prevalent PD, 317 with incident PD, and 381 age- and sex-matched controls. Optic disc pallor in several zones was quantified using semi-automated software. We used logistic and linear regression, adjusted for relevant covariates, to test for associations between disc pallor and PD status and duration. Participants with prevalent PD had significantly paler optic discs globally (OR per standard deviation [SD] increase = 1.39 [CI: 1.08-1.81], P = 0.012) and across several zones compared to controls. Each year since PD diagnosis was associated with a 1.37 SD increase in global pallor (standardized β = 1.37 [SE = 0.61], P = 0.029), and a similar increase across several zones, however, this finding was sensitive to outliers with long disease duration. No significant associations were observed for the incident PD group. Optic disc pallor is significantly associated with PD and may become more pronounced with disease duration. This suggests that optic disc pallor, measured in routinely taken color fundus photographs, may serve as a biomarker for PD-related neurodegeneration. © 2025 The Author(s).

39885672,Chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI for neurodegenerative diseases: an update on clinical and preclinical studies.,"Chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging is an advanced imaging technique that enables the detection of compounds at low concentrations with high sensitivity and spatial resolution and has been extensively studied for diagnosing malignancy and stroke. In recent years, the emerging exploration of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging for detecting pathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases has opened up new possibilities for early detection and repetitive scans without ionizing radiation. This review serves as an overview of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging with detailed information on contrast mechanisms and processing methods and summarizes recent developments in both clinical and preclinical studies of chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease.A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, focusing on peer-reviewed articles from the past 15 years relevant to clinical and preclinical applications. The findings suggest that chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to detect molecular changes and altered metabolism, which may aid in early diagnosis and assessment of the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. Although promising results have been observed in selected clinical and preclinical trials, further validations are needed to evaluate their clinical value. When combined with other imaging modalities and advanced analytical methods, chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging shows potential as an in vivo biomarker, enhancing the understanding of neuropathological mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.",1
39884117,Disease continuum centered on Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), once viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder, is now increasingly recognized as part of a broader disease continuum, intricately linked to comorbidities across various organ systems. This study provides a snapshot of the disease continuum centered on PD, using a disease-wide association study (DWAS) involving 392,423 individuals-including 4,235 PD cases. This DWAS identifies disease clusters of PD comorbidities across the musculoskeletal, circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems. Moreover, comorbidities were classified based on their temporal relationship to PD diagnosis: pre-PD comorbidities, such as hypertension and autoimmune disorders, may act as risk factors of PD onset, while post-PD comorbidities, including Alzheimer's disease and renal disorders, highlight the systemic consequences of PD progression. These findings emphasize the critical need for early detection and intervention to manage comorbidities and potentially delay PD onset. Furthermore, this study advocates for integrated diagnostic and therapeutic strategies targeting shared risk factors, advancing a precision-medicine approach to improve patient care and long-term management of PD.",1
39880275,"Executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: From neurochemistry to circuits, genetics and neuroimaging.","Cognitive decline is one of the most significant non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), with executive dysfunction (EDF) being the most prominent characteristic of PD-associated cognitive deficits. Currently, lack of uniformity in the conceptualization and assessment scales for executive functions impedes the early and accurate diagnosis of EDF in PD. The neurobiological mechanisms of EDF in PD remain poorly understood. Moreover, the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD has progressed slowly and with limited efficacy. Thus, this review explores the characteristics and potential mechanisms of EDF in PD from multiple perspectives, including the concept of executive function, commonly used neuropsychological tests, neurobiochemistry, genetics, electroencephalographic activity and neuroimaging. The available evidence indicates that degeneration of the frontal-striatal circuit, along with mutations in the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, may contribute to EDF in patients with PD. The increase in theta and delta waves, along with the decrease in alpha waves, offers potential biomarkers for the early identification and monitoring of EDF, as well as the development of dementia in patients with PD. The PD cognition-related pattern (PDCP) pattern may serve as a tool for monitoring and assessing cognitive function progression in these patients and is anticipated to become a biomarker for cognitive disorders associated with PD. The aim is to provide new insights for the early and precise diagnosis and treatment of EDF in PD.",1
39878857,Nanotechnology in Parkinson's Disease: overcoming drug delivery challenges and enhancing therapeutic outcomes.,"The global prevalence of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is on the rise, driven by an ageing population and ongoing environmental conditions. To gain a better understanding of PD pathogenesis, it is essential to consider its relationship with the ageing process, as ageing stands out as the most significant risk factor for this neurodegenerative condition. PD risk factors encompass genetic predisposition, exposure to environmental toxins, and lifestyle influences, collectively increasing the chance of PD development. Moreover, early and precise PD diagnosis remains elusive, relying on clinical assessments, neuroimaging techniques, and emerging biomarkers. Conventional management of PD involves dopaminergic medications and surgical interventions, but these treatments often become less effective over time and do not address disease treatment. Challenges persist due to the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability, hindering drug delivery. Recent advancements in nanotechnology offer promising novel approaches for PD management. Various drug delivery systems (DDS), including nanosized polymers, lipid-based carriers, and nanoparticles (such as metal/metal oxide, protein, and carbonaceous particles), aim to enhance drug and gene delivery. These modifications seek to improve BBB permeability, ultimately benefiting PD patients. This review underscores the critical role of ageing in PD development and explores how age-related neuronal decline contributes to substantia nigra loss and PD manifestation in susceptible individuals. The review also highlights the advancements and ongoing challenges in nanotechnology-based therapies for PD.",1
39873863,Confined active area and aggregation kinetic-based AuNPs@PVP nanosensors for simultaneous colorimetric detection of cysteine and homocysteine as homologues in human urine and serum.,"The detection of cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) in biological fluids has great significance for early diagnosis, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The simultaneous determination of Cys and Hcy with a single probe is still a huge challenge. To enlarge the differences in space structure (line and ring) and energy (-721.78 and -761.08 Hartree) between Cys and Hcy, and to cause a difference of aggregation kinetics, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are capped with hydrophilic and low-toxic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (named AuNPs@PVP) and some surface-active sites of AuNPs are masked, the active area for the binding between AuNPs and the detection object is confined, meanwhile, the stability of AuNPs is improved. A novel nanosensor based on confined active area and aggregation kinetics of AuNPs@PVP, is designed for the identification and determination of Cys and Hcy in 1 and 3 min, respectively, with sufficiently low detection limit (4.12 and 4.35 μM) and linear range (4.12-100 μM) for health evaluation. This single colorimetric sensor was applied successfully to the determination of urine and serum, evidencing high anti-interference ability.",1
39871882,"Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Findings in Parkinson's Disease With ""Antecedent Essential Tremor"": A Case Series of a Large Kindred.","The clinical pictures of essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are often quite mimic at the early stage, and longstanding ET may ultimately develop to PD, that is, PD with ""antecedent ET"". Early diagnosis and differentiation of the two are essential for predicting disease progression and formulating individualized treatment plans. However, current approaches remain challenging. This study aimed at determining the morphological, microstructural and iron-related changes in these patients' brains using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We reviewed a kindred with ET and PD with ""antecedent ET"" recruited at our hospital in May 2023. The clinical characteristics, genetic testing and multimodal MRI data of 16 family members were collected. Multimodal MRI analysis included structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Two second-generation family members diagnosed PD had ET history before PD performance appeared, five third-generation family members were diagnosed with ET. Fifteen of the 16 cases had missense mutation in the EIF4G1 gene. Temporal and spatial features of morphology and iron deposition in different brain regions were heterogeneous. DTI showed that the cerebello-thalamo-motor cortical network was involved in both ET and PD cases, and the additional nigrostriatal-thalamo-motor cortical network was involved in PD cases. The combination of morphometric imaging, DTI and QSM could be used as an imaging biomarker for ET and PD diagnosis and could be an effective tool for longitudinal monitoring of disease progression and transformation.",1
39870679,Dual-task-related gait patterns as possible marker of precocious and subclinical cognitive alterations in Parkinson disease.,"Subtle gait and cognitive dysfunction are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), even before most evident clinical manifestations. Such alterations can be assumed as hypothetical phenotypical and prognostic/progression markers. To compare spatiotemporal gait parameters in PD patients with three cognitive status: cognitively intact (PD-noCI), with subjective cognitive impairment (PD-SCI) and with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) in order to detect subclinical gait differences. One hundred PD patients were consecutively enrolled and divided in three groups based on both the first item od MDS-UPDRS part I and an extensive neuropsychological evaluation: 41 PD-noCI, 15 PD-SCI and 44 PD-MCI. They were evaluated with gait analysis acquired in three different conditions (normal gait, motor and cognitive dual task). Spatiotemporal variables were extracted. A univariate statistical analysis (parametric ANOVA test or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate) with post-hoc analysis was carried out in order to evaluate the significant differences among the groups. In normal gait task, the three groups showed several differences, all due to the comparison between PD-MCI and PD-noCI, as disclosed by post-hoc analysis. In dual task conditions, mostly in the cognitive dual task, the three groups showed increased gait alterations that, at post-hoc analysis, mirrored the magnitude of cognitive dysfunction (PD-noCI < PD-SCI < PD-MCI). Peculiar prodromal gait patterns-especially those highlighted by cognitive dual task-could be considered possible markers to objectify self-reported symptoms-based construct, like SCI, and to early intercept subjects with different clinical evolutions and prognoses, even representing an innovative clustering/phenotyping tool for PD subtypes.",1
39860708,Biomechanics Parameters of Gait Analysis to Characterize Parkinson's Disease: A Scoping Review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a slow, short-stepping, shuffling gait pattern caused by a combination of motor control limitations due to a reduction in dopaminergic neurons. Gait disorders are indicators of global health, cognitive status, and risk of falls and increase with disease progression. Therefore, the use of quantitative information on the gait mechanisms of PD patients is a promising approach, particularly for monitoring gait disorders and potentially informing therapeutic interventions, though it is not yet a well-established tool for early diagnosis or direct assessment of disease progression. Over the years, many studies have investigated the spatiotemporal parameters that are altered in the PD gait pattern, while kinematic and kinetic gait parameters are more limited. A scoping review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. The Scopus and PubMed databases were searched between 1999 and 2023. A total of 29 articles were included that reported gait changes in PD patients under different gait conditions: single free walking, sequential motor task, and dual task. The main findings of our review highlighted the use of optoelectronic systems for recording kinematic parameters and force plates for measuring kinetic parameters, due to their high accuracy. Most gait analyses in PD patients have been conducted at self-selected walking speeds to capture natural movement, although studies have also examined gait under various conditions. The results of our review indicated that PD patients experience alterations in the range of motion of the hip, knee, and ankle joints, as well as a reduction in the power generated/absorbed and the extensor/flexor moments. These findings suggest that the PD gait pattern may be more effectively understood using kinematic and kinetic parameters.",1
39853853,Polygenic risk discriminates Lewy body dementia from Alzheimer's disease.,"Lewy body dementia (LBD) shares genetic risk factors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), including apolipoprotein E (APOE), but is distinguishable at the genome-wide level. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) may therefore improve diagnostic classification. We assessed diagnostic classification using AD-PRS excluding APOE (AD-PRS Together AD-PRS Aβ deposition in LBD was associated with APOE, while MCI+/AD was also associated with AD-PRS beyond APOE. AD-PRS explains phenotypic variance not captured by APOE or p-tau181. We investigated Alzheimer's disease (AD) polygenic risk score (PRS), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) to classify AD and Lewy body dementia (LBD). AD-PRS with APOE achieved similar classification accuracy to p-tau181. AD-PRS without APOE significantly contributed to discriminating AD from LBD. Amyloid beta positivity in LBD was associated with APOE but not AD-PRS without APOE or p-tau181. Combining AD-PRS, APOE, and p-tau181 improved diagnostic classification accuracy.",1
39851446,Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Early Diagnosis and Monitoring of Movement Disorders.,"Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are transforming the study of movement disorders by providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms. This narrative review presents a comprehensive overview of their applications in this field, offering an updated perspective on their potential for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and therapeutic evaluation. Emerging MRI modalities such as neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometry provide sensitive biomarkers that can detect early microstructural degeneration, iron deposition, and connectivity disruptions in key regions like the substantia nigra. These techniques enable earlier and more accurate differentiation of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body and frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and dystonia. Furthermore, MRI provides objective metrics for tracking disease progression and assessing therapeutic efficacy, making it an indispensable tool in clinical trials. Despite these advances, the absence of standardized protocols limits their integration into routine clinical practice. Addressing this gap and incorporating these techniques more systematically could bring the field closer to leveraging advanced MRI for personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with movement disorders.",1
39851331,FundusNet: A Deep-Learning Approach for Fast Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative and Eye Diseases Using Fundus Images.,"Early-stage detection of neurodegenerative diseases is crucial for effective clinical treatment. However, current diagnostic methods are expensive and time-consuming. In this study, we present FundusNet, a deep-learning model trained on fundus images, for rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. FundusNet achieved superior performance in age prediction (MAE 2.55 year), gender classification (AUC 0.98), and neurodegenerative disease diagnosis-Parkinson's disease AUC 0.75 ± 0.03, multiple sclerosis AUC 0.77 ± 0.02. Grad-CAM was used to identify which part of the image contributes to diagnosis. Imaging biomarker interpretation demonstrated that FundusNet effectively identifies clinical retina structures associated with diseases. Additionally, the model's high accuracy in predicting genetic risk suggests that its performance could be further enhanced with larger training datasets.",1
39851285,Exploring the Potential Imaging Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning Approach.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Dopamine transporter scan (DATSCAN), based on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), is commonly used to evaluate the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. This study aims to identify a biomarker from DATSCAN images and develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm for PD diagnosis. Using 13 DATSCAN-derived parameters and patient handedness from 1309 individuals in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, we trained an AdaBoost classifier, achieving an accuracy of 98.88% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 99.81%. To ensure interpretability, we applied the local interpretable model-agnostic explainer (LIME), identifying contralateral putamen SBR as the most predictive feature for distinguishing PD from healthy controls. By focusing on a single biomarker, our approach simplifies PD diagnosis, integrates seamlessly into clinical workflows, and provides interpretable, actionable insights. Although DATSCAN has limitations in detecting early-stage PD, our study demonstrates the potential of ML to enhance diagnostic precision, contributing to improved clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.",1
39851136,Potential biofluid markers for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.,"Cognitive impairment is a particularly severe non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that significantly diminishes the quality of life of affected individuals. Identifying reliable biomarkers for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease is essential for early diagnosis, prognostic assessments, and the development of targeted therapies. This review aims to summarize recent advancements in biofluid biomarkers for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the detection of specific proteins, metabolites, and other biomarkers in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. These biomarkers can shed light on the multifaceted etiology of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which includes protein misfolding, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The integration of biofluid biomarkers with neuroimaging and clinical data can facilitate the development of predictive models to enhance early diagnosis and monitor the progression of cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease. This comprehensive approach can improve the existing understanding of the mechanisms driving cognitive decline and support the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying the course of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. Despite the promise of these biomarkers in characterizing the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease, further research is necessary to validate their clinical utility and establish a standardized framework for early detection and monitoring of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.",1
39850414,Abnormal dynamic features of cortical microstates for detecting early-stage Parkinson's disease by resting-state electroencephalography: Systematic analysis of the influence of eye condition.,"Resting state electroencephalography (EEG) has proved useful in studying electrophysiological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. In many neuropathologies, microstate analysis of the eyes-closed (EC) scalp EEG is a robust and highly reproducible technique for assessing topological changes with high temporal resolution. However, scalp EEG microstate maps tend to underestimate the non-occipital or non-alpha-band networks, which can also be used to detect neuropathological changes. Recent evidence has shown that the source-space microstates can characterize distinct functional connectivity patterns but its clinical ability to detect neuropathological changes has not been demonstrated so far. It should also be remembered that the eye condition may play an important role in neural activity dynamics. The aim of this study was to systematically characterize the dynamic neuropathological features of sensor-space and source-space EEG microstates in PD patients with no cognitive impairment in both EC and EO conditions with the aim of identifying potential biomarkers that could be used as a complementary clinical screening method for early PD detection. We found that the dynamic features of the source-space microstates were more sensitive in detecting PD than the sensor-space microstates, while EO was able to detect neuropathological changes in PD patients better than EC. In EO, PD disease exhibited significantly higher occurrence and coverage in visual-network related source-space microstates and abnormally high duration in sensorimotor network-related microstates. Our results suggest that the source-space microstate analysis of resting-state EEG could provide robust biomarkers to detect early-stage PD, which would allow the development of patient-oriented strategies to prevent the disease and improve the patients' quality of life.",1
39847572,Postural instability and gait disturbance are associated with abnormal stereopsis in Parkinson's disease.,"Visual dysfunction, including abnormal stereopsis, is a significant non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) that can reduce quality of life and appears early in the disease. Abnormal stereopsis is associated with worsening of bradykinesia and freezing of gait, though the exact pathways linking stereopsis to motor symptoms remain unclear. Furthermore, in PD patients, the pedunculopontine nucleus and laterodorsal tegmental complex play an active role in sensorimotor control, and these areas provide cholinergic projections. Cholinergic degeneration may be associated with symptoms such as abnormal stereopsis, postural instability, gait disturbances and cognitive impairment. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that a high postural instability and gait disturbance score would increase the risk of abnormal stereopsis in PD. We designed a cross-sectional study and included 240 early PD patients without ophthalmologic problems other than abnormal stereopsis. To evaluate stereopsis, we used Titmus stereo test plates. Stereopsis testing was performed only once at the time of the patient's initial PD diagnosis. We collected data from medical history taking, scales, cognitive function tests, gait analysis, and tilt table tests. To analyze the potential risk factors for abnormal stereopsis in PD, we conducted a binary logistic stepwise selection analysis. Among the total of 240 PD patients, 185 were in the normal stereopsis group and 55 were in the abnormal stereopsis group. In the analysis for risk factors related to abnormal stereopsis, the postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD) subtype score was significantly associated with abnormal stereopsis. (95% confidence interval: 1.37-5.15). In PD, particularly in PIGD subtype patients, abnormal stereopsis can lead to a decrease in the quality of sensory information, potentially interfering with feedback and adaptation processes. This, in turn, can negatively affect posture and gait, creating a vicious cycle.",1
39846482,Early Motor Signs in Pathologically Verified Alzheimer's Disease and Lewy Body Disease.,"The neuropathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) commonly co-occur. Parkinsonism is the hallmark feature in LBD but it can be difficult to predict the presence of these co-pathologies early in the course of clinical disease. Timely diagnosis has crucial implications, especially with the advent of disease-modifying therapies. We sought to define early motor features that predict the ultimate neuropathological diagnoses of normal, AD, AD with concurrent LB pathology, and pure LB. We examined the associations between individuals' early motor features from their initial visit using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III and their neuropathological diagnoses using the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Database. We included data from participants with neuropathologically normal brains (n = 49), AD (n = 502), AD w/LB (n = 167), and pure LB (n = 51). Total UPDRS Part III scores were increasingly higher with purer LB pathology. Decreased facial expression at baseline differentiated those with AD w/LB pathology from those with AD. Participants having pure LB pathology more often had deficits in speech, facial expression, posture, gait, bradykinesia, and upper extremity rigidity relative to those with AD w/LB. Diminished facial expression significantly predicted the presence of LBs among those with concurrent AD pathology. Worse early speech, facial expression, posture, gait, bradykinesia, and upper extremity rigidity were suggestive of more pure LB pathology. These findings emphasize the utility of the neurological exam in the clinical assessment of persons with cognitive complaints as it can guide management.",1

39840019,Olfactory dysfunction as potential biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases: a narrative review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases represent a group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of neurons in the central nervous system, leading to a range of cognitive, motor, and sensory impairments. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the association between neurodegenerative diseases and olfactory dysfunction (OD). Characterized by a decline in the ability to detect or identify odors, OD has been observed in various conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This phenomenon often precedes the onset of other clinical symptoms, suggesting its potential utility as an early marker or prodromal symptom of neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a vast literature overview on the current knowledge of OD in PD, AD, ALS, and HD in order to evaluate its potential as a biomarker, particularly in the early and prodromal stages of these diseases. We summarize the most common methods used to measure olfactory function and delve into neuropathological correlations and the alterations in neurotransmitter systems associated with OD in those neurodegenerative diseases, including differences in genetic variants if applicable, and cater to current pitfalls and shortcomings in the research.",1
39838822,Amygdala-centered fusional connections characterized nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.,"The importance of nonmotor symptoms in understanding the pathogenesis of the heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease has been highlighted. However, the validation of specific brain network biomarkers in nonmotor symptom subtypes is currently lacking. By performing a new approach to compute functional connectivity with structural prior using magnetic resonance imaging, the present study computed both functional connectivity and fusional connectivity features in the nonmotor symptom subtypes of Parkinson's disease, one characterized by cognitive impairment with late onset and the other depression with early onset. The functional connectivity and fusional connectivity features centered at the left amygdala were both detected. The fusional features significantly enhanced the classification performance. The amygdala-postcentral and amygdala-orbital frontal features were critical for cognitive impairment with late onset detection, while the amygdala-temporooccipital features were crucial for depression with early onset detection. Additionally, the fusional connectivity features between the amygdala and the junction sulcus of parietooccipital and temporooccipital regions contributed significantly to differentiating cognitive impairment with late onset and depression with early onset. The within-subtype correlation analysis revealed that age at onset and cognitive scores were associated with features of amygdala-somatosensory/visual-motor processing areas in cognitive impairment with late onset, while related to features of amygdala-emotional processing areas in depression with early onset. Our findings highlighted distinct amygdala-centered fusional connectivity features related to diverse nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, offering new insights for pathogenesis-targeted treatments for specific Parkinson's disease subtypes.",1
39837464,Association of sarcopenia with Parkinson's disease and related functional degeneration among older adults: A prospective cohort study in Europe.,"Former evidence on the risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD), especially the PD-related functional limitation and neurological outcomes was scarce. We aimed to explore the association between sarcopenia and PD along with the PD-related functional degeneration. Further, we testified the heterogeneity in the above relationships of multimorbidity severity and patterns. Data was from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (wave 4-8). PD was ascertained by self-reported doctor diagnosis. PD-related functional degeneration was defined as the coexistence of PD and functional limitation, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia. Sarcopenia status was determined by the criteria of European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People in 2019. Cox regression models were conducted to examine the association between sarcopenia and PD risk. Among 40,041 participants, those with sarcopenia were significantly associated with onset of PD (HR = 2.16, 95 % CI: 1.41-3.31), along with related functional limitation (HR = 2.58, 95 % CI: 1.59-4.19), MCI (HR = 2.93, 95 % CI: 1.37-5.15), and dementia (HR = 6.05, 95 % CI: 3.17-11.56). Heterogeneity of multimorbidity severity and patterns was found in the relationship of sarcopenia with PD-related functional limitation and MCI and the observed associations only existed among those with highest level of multimorbidity severity and those with complicated pattern. Sarcopenia status was correlated to PD and the related functional degeneration, and the difference in the above relationships of multimorbidity patterns and severity was observed. Early screening on sarcopenia-related indicators and more emphasis on the precaution of PD among those with severe and complicated multimorbidity patterns were recommended.",1
39833219,Efficient recognition of Parkinson's disease mice on stepping characters with CNN.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, impacts the quality of life for over 12 million patients. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of early diagnosis of PD through non-invasive methods, with the goal of enabling earlier intervention in the disease process. To this end, we constructed an open-field environment using flexible sensors under dark conditions, conducting experiments on a mouse model of Parkinson's disease alongside a normal control group. By processing footprint images collected in the absence of light-employing numerical area summation for noise reduction, adaptive enhancement algorithms based on pixel values, and a high-accuracy Convolutional Neural Network algorithm. And integrating motion data analysis, we achieved effective fusion of footprint images and behavioral data. After comprehensive analysis using decision-level fusion techniques and a Naive Bayes classifier, the results showed that the average classification accuracy for PD mice reached 96.56% when employing a multimodal data fusion strategy, demonstrating a significant advantage over using a single image recognition technique. This research not only highlights the substantial potential of applying multimodal data fusion strategies in the early detection of Parkinson's disease but also proves that such an approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. The findings provide new insights into the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.",1
39833111,"Impact of motor features on non-motor symptoms in patients with de novo Parkinson's disease: Cognition, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and dysautonomia.","Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) present with both motor and non-motor symptoms, and understanding the interplay between these symptoms is crucial for individualized patient care. This study aims to investigate the relationship between motor features and non-motor symptoms in patients with de novo PD. A total of 105 patients were analyzed, focusing on motor subtypes or subscores and their impact on cognition, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and dysautonomia. We utilized the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-part III (UPDRS-III) for motor assessment, and various validated scales for non-motor symptoms. Compared with tremor-dominant (TD) patients, non-TD patients showed severe scores in fatigue and dysautonomia, but no difference in other non-motor symptoms, including global cognition, depression, and anxiety. Linear regression analysis revealed that the total motor score of UPDRS-III was negatively related to global cognition (β = -0.4454, P = 0.0121). As a post-hoc analysis, partial correlation analysis showed that rigidity and bradykinesia subscores were associated with global cognition (r = -0.3527, P = 0.0004; r = -0.2206, P = 0.0299, respectively), whereas the postural instability/gait difficulty subscore was associated with depression, anxiety, fatigue, and dysautonomia (r = 0.2181, P = 0.0319; r = 0.2371, P = 0.0194; r = 0.3659, P = 0.0002; r = 0.3968, P = 0.0001, respectively) but not with global cognition. These results suggest that motor features in the early stages of PD can serve as important indicators of non-motor symptoms, potentially guiding more personalized therapeutic approaches.

39832626,PIDGN: An explainable multimodal deep learning framework for early prediction of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world, is usually not diagnosed until the later stages of the disease, when patients might have already missed the best treatment period. Therefore, more effective prediction methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) are needed to assist physicians in timely diagnosis. An explainable deep learning-based early Parkinson's disease diagnostic model, Parkinson's Integrative Diagnostic Gated Network (PIDGN), was designed by fusing Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and brain sMRI data. Firstly, unimodal internal information was extracted using EmsembleTree dimensionality reduction method, Transformer encoder and 3D ResNet. Secondly, gated attention fusion technique was utilized to explore the inter-modal interactions. Finally, the classification results were output through the fully connected layer. SHapley additive interpretation (SHAP) values and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) techniques were used to help explain the importance of SNPs and brain regions for PD. The results showed that the PIDGN model achieved the best results with the accuracy of 0.858 and AUROC of 0.897. Top 20 SNPs and the brain regions near the midbrain potentially related to PD were identified using two explainable techniques via SHAP values and Grad-CAM respectively. The PIDGN model trained by fusing genetic and imaging data outperforms 13 other commonly used unimodal or bimodal models. Explainable PIDGN model helps deepen understanding of several SNPs and sMRI key factors that may affect PD. This study provides a potentially effective solution for automated early diagnosis of PD using AI.",1
39829767,Strategic Modulation of Polarity and Viscosity Sensitivity of Bimane Molecular Rotor-Based Fluorophores for Imaging α-Synuclein.,"Molecular rotor-based fluorophores (RBFs) that are target-selective and sensitive to both polarity and viscosity are valuable for diverse biological applications. Here, we have designed next-generation RBFs based on the underexplored bimane fluorophore through either changing in aryl substitution or varying π-linkages between the rotatable electron donors and acceptors to produce red-shifted fluorescence emissions with large Stokes shifts. RBFs exhibit a twisted intramolecular charge transfer mechanism that enables control of polarity and viscosity sensitivity, as well as target selectivity. These features enable their application in: (1) turn-on fluorescent detection of α-synuclein (αS) fibrils, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), including amplified fibrils from patient samples; (2) monitoring early misfolding and oligomer formation during αS aggregation; and (3) selective imaging of αS condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In all three cases, we show that our probes have high levels of selectivity for αS versus other aggregating proteins. These properties enable one to study the interplay of αS and tau in amyloid aggregation and the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders.",1
39829206,Recognition and classification of facial expression using artificial intelligence as a key of early detection in neurological disorders.,"The recognition and classification of facial expressions using artificial intelligence (AI) presents a promising avenue for early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders. This narrative review critically examines the current state of AI-driven facial expression analysis in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. We discuss the potential of AI techniques, including deep learning and computer vision, to accurately interpret and categorize subtle changes in facial expressions associated with these pathological conditions. Furthermore, we explore the role of facial expression recognition as a noninvasive, cost-effective tool for screening, disease progression tracking, and personalized intervention in neurodegenerative disorders. The review also addresses the challenges, ethical considerations, and future prospects of integrating AI-based facial expression analysis into clinical practice for early intervention and improved quality of life for individuals at risk of or affected by neurodegenerative diseases.",1
39819742,Peripheral proteinopathy in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Proteinopathies in neurology typically refer to pathological changes in proteins associated with neurological diseases, such as the aggregation of amyloid β and Tau in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Interestingly, these proteins are also commonly found in peripheral tissues, raising important questions about their roles in neurological disorders. Multiple studies have shown that peripherally derived pathological proteins not only travel to the brain through various routes, aggravating brain pathology, but also contribute significantly to peripheral dysfunction, highlighting their crucial impact on neurological diseases. Investigating how these peripherally derived proteins influence the progression of neurological disorders could open new horizons for achieving early diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes the distribution, transportation pathways, and pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodegenerative disease-related pathological proteins in the periphery, proposing that targeting these peripheral pathological proteins could be a promising strategy for preventing and managing neurological diseases.",1
39817395,White Matter Fiber Bundle Alterations Correlate with Gait and Cognitive Impairments in Parkinson's Disease based on HARDI Data.,"The neuroanatomical basis of white matter fiber tracts in gait impairments in individuals suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD) is unclear. Twenty-four individuals living with PD and 29 Healthy Controls (HCs) were included. For each participant, two-shell High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) and high-resolution 3D structural images were acquired using the 3T MRI. Diffusion-weighted data preprocessing was performed using the orientation distribution function to trace the main fiber tracts in PD individuals. Clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and the correlation between the FA value and behavioral data was analyzed. Quantitative gait and clinical parameters were recorded in PD at ON and OFF states, respectively. The mean tract-specific FA values of the right Cingulum Cingulate (rCC) were statistically different between the PD group and the HC group (p =0.047). The FA value of 34-58 equidistant nodes in rCC was positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (r=0.527, p=0.024), Berg Balance Scale (BBS)-OFF (r=0.480, p =0.040), and BBS-ON (r=0.528, p =0.024) scores, while it was negatively correlated with the MDS-UPDRS-III-ON score (r=-0.502, p =0.030). Regarding the gait analysis, the FA value was significantly correlated with velocity, cadence, and stride time of the pace and rhythm domains in both 'ON' and 'OFF' states, respectively (p<0.05). This study served as an initial exploration to establish that HARDI sequences could be employed as a robust tool for analyzing microstructural alterations in white matter fiber bundles among PD patients, although the sample size was small. We confirmed microstructural integrity impairment of rCC to be significantly associated with both gait and cognitive deficits in patients with PD. Early detection of microstructural changes in rCC and targeted treatment can help improve behavioral disorders. In the future, we intend to further integrate multimodal data with assessments of patient behavior both prior to and following intervention. We will validate our findings within an independent cohort to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",1
39812863,Longitudinal qualitative assessment of meaningful symptoms and relevance of WATCH-PD digital measures for people with early Parkinson's.,"Longitudinal qualitative data on what matters to people with Parkinson's disease are lacking and needed to guide patient-centered clinical care and development of outcome measures. To evaluate change over time in symptoms, impacts, and relevance of digital measures to monitor disease progression in early Parkinson's. In-depth, online symptom mapping interviews were conducted with 33 people with early Parkinson's at baseline and 1 year later to evaluate (A) symptoms, (B) impacts, and (C) relevance of digital measures to monitor personally relevant symptoms. Maps and transcripts were coded for frequencies, Likert scale rankings (0 = not present to 4 = most bothersome), and thematic findings. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to evaluate change over time. Other than walking and balance, most motor symptoms did not change significantly from baseline to 1 year later. Multiple significant changes were observed in non-motor areas (cognition, speech, sleep, mood, fatigue, pain; p < 0.05) and functional impacts (mobility, effort to do usual activities, personal comfort; p < 0.05). Thematic analysis revealed ability to cope with and compensate for actual or anticipated symptoms reduced disruptions to well-being and changed how bothersome symptoms were. All digital measures targeted symptoms that were personally important to most participants (> 80%). Non-motor and walking/balance symptoms changed sooner than other motor symptoms during the course of 1 year. Evaluation of coping and compensatory mechanisms may be essential to understanding symptom bothersomeness at a given point in time. Smartphone and smartwatch digital measures were relevant to personally meaningful symptoms of early PD.",1
39812846,Diagnosis of hereditary ataxias: a real-world single center experience.,"This study aims to evaluate our experience in the diagnosis of hereditary ataxias (HAs), to analyze data from a real-world scenario. This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted at a single Italian adult neurogenetic outpatient clinic, in 147 patients affected by ataxia with a suspicion of hereditary forms, recruited from November 1999 to February 2024. A stepwise approach for molecular diagnostics was applied: targeted gene panel (TP) next-generation sequencing (NGS) and/or clinical exome sequencing (CES) were performed in the case of inconclusive first-line genetic testing, such as short tandem repeat expansions (TREs) testing for most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1-3, 6-8,12,17, DRPLA), other forms [Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and mitochondrial DNA-related ataxia, RFC1-related ataxia/CANVAS] or inconclusive phenotype-guided specific single gene sequencing. A definitive diagnosis was reached in 36.7% of the cases. TREs testing was diagnostic in 30.4% of patients. The three most common TREs ataxias were FRDA (36.1%), SCA2 (27.8%), and RFC1-related ataxia/CANVAS (11.1%). In five patients, the molecular diagnosis was achieved by single gene sequencing and causative mutations were identified in POLG (2), SACS (1), DARS2 (1), MT-ATP6 (1). Of 94 patients with a suspicion of HAs of indeterminate genetic origin, 68 underwent new molecular evaluation using the NGS approach. In 28 of these cases, CES was performed after the TP sequencing resulted negative. In 13 patients, the diagnosis was achieved by NGS approach. In 7 of these 13 patients, the diagnosis was made by CES. Genes mutations identified as causative of HAs were found in SPG7 (4), SACS (1), CACNA1A (1), CACNA1G (1), EEF2 (1), PRKCG (1), KCNC3 (1), ADCK3 (1), SYNE1 (1), ITPR1 (1). A positive family history of ataxia and early onset of symptoms were associated with a higher likelihood of obtaining a definite diagnosis. The molecular diagnosis of HAs remains a significant challenge for neurologists. Our data indicate that, in most cases, a diagnosis of HA can be established through first line genetic testing, particularly TREs testing. However, for patients with a clinical diagnosis of HA who do not achieve a molecular diagnosis through initial genetic tests, the use of NGS proves to be a valuable tool, providing a definitive diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases. Therefore, when feasible in clinical practice, integrating NGS testing, especially exome sequencing, into the diagnostic decision-making process for unsolved cases is crucial.",1

39798255,"A Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous prasinezumab in early-stage Parkinson's disease (PADOVA): Rationale, design, and baseline data.","Prasinezumab was shown to potentially delay motor progression in individuals with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) who were either treatment-naïve or on monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor (MAO-Bi) therapy in the PASADENA study. We report the rationale, design, and baseline patient characteristics of the PADOVA study, designed to evaluate prasinezumab in an early-stage PD population receiving standard-of-care (SOC) symptomatic medications. PADOVA (NCT04777331) is a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, in which individuals with early-stage PD on SOC stable symptomatic monotherapy (levodopa or MAO-Bi) receive intravenous prasinezumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint is time to confirmed motor progression, defined as ≥5 points increase from baseline on the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III in practically defined OFF-medication state. 586 participants were enrolled between May 5th, 2021 and March 22nd, 2023. At baseline, 74.2 % and 25.8 % of participants were receiving levodopa and MAO-Bi, respectively. Mean age was 64.2 years and 63.5 % were male. Mean time from diagnosis was 18.6 months, 85 % of participants were in Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) Stage 2, and mean MDS-UPDRS Part III score was 24.5. Compared with the PASADENA population, PADOVA participants were older (∼5 years), with longer disease duration (∼8 months), and slightly more advanced based on H&Y stage (10 % more in Stage 2) and MDS-UPDRS Part III (∼3 points more). PADOVA has successfully recruited an early-stage PD population to test the effect of prasinezumab when added to background SOC.",1
39795532,Parkinson's Disease Prediction: An Attention-Based Multimodal Fusion Framework Using Handwriting and Clinical Data.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NGD) encompass a range of progressive neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), characterised by the gradual deterioration of neuronal structure and function. This degeneration manifests as cognitive decline, movement impairment, and dementia. Our focus in this investigation is on PD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to motor disturbances. Early detection of PD is paramount for enhancing quality of life through timely intervention and tailored treatment. However, the subtle nature of initial symptoms, like slow movements, tremors, muscle rigidity, and psychological changes, often reduce daily task performance and complicate early diagnosis. To assist medical professionals in timely diagnosis of PD, we introduce a cutting-edge Multimodal Diagnosis framework (PMMD). Based on deep learning techniques, the PMMD framework integrates imaging, handwriting, drawing, and clinical data to accurately detect PD. Notably, it incorporates cross-modal attention, a methodology previously unexplored within the area, which facilitates the modelling of interactions between different data modalities. The proposed method exhibited an accuracy of 96% on the independent tests set. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models, along with an in-depth exploration of attention mechanisms, highlights the efficacy of PMMD in PD classification. The obtained results highlight exciting new prospects for the use of handwriting as a biomarker, along with other information, for optimal model performance. PMMD's success in integrating diverse data sources through cross-modal attention underscores its potential as a robust diagnostic decision support tool for accurately diagnosing PD.",1
39794607,A smart tool for non expert clinicians for the dissemination of the MDS criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy.,"Due to the variety of clinical phenotypes and the massive clinical overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases, the diagnosis of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) remains a major challenge. Notwithstanding, early and reliable clinical diagnosis of PSP is highly warranted for estimation of prognosis, appropriate allocation to therapeutic trials and development of new diagnostic tools. As reliable biomarkers are lacking, PSP diagnosis relies on the application of the clinical criteria promoted by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS). Despite providing a framework including all the main PSP cornerstones (ocular dysfunction and postural instability, akinesia and cognitive dysfunction), the application of the MDS PSP criteria is complex and not straightforward to apply in a clinical setting. Herein we propose a practical tool, including a video-guided slide-set and a smartsheet, to disseminate the MDS PSP clinical criteria among healthy practitioners and increase confidence in non expert clinicians towards suspicion and diagnosis of PSP. The video-guided slide set may serve as a teaching resource for both general neurologists and practitioners, while the smartsheet may represent a valid support in attributing the degree of diagnostic certainty and phenotype based on the identified clinical features. Application of our tool may improve early recognition of patients in primary and secondary care and determine a prompt referral to third level movement disorder centers for consideration in clinical trials testing disease-modifying treatments.",1
39793854,Deciphering the role of neuropeptides as biomarkers for early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition and is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Early diagnosis is essential for effective therapy and management; nevertheless, present diagnostic methods are frequently insufficient and primarily rely on clinical symptoms that appear later in the disease. Neuropeptides, such as alpha-synuclein (α-syn), Substance P (SP), neurotensin (Nts), Neuropeptide Y (NPY), and somatostatin (SST), exhibit significant potential as biomarkers for the early identification of Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is closely associated with the dysregulation of these neuropeptides, which are essential in many neurophysiological processes. Advancements in detection technologies, including the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), have rendered it possible to precisely and sensitively quantify neuropeptides in a variety of bodily fluids, including blood, saliva, tears, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Studies show that PD patients have different amounts of neuropeptides in their biological fluids. These differences are correlated with the severity of the disease and help to distinguish PD patients apart from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Despite being less investigated, Nts and SST are also involved in neuroprotection and dopaminergic transmission, they too hold significant characteristics as diagnostic biomarkers. This article highlights the possible use of neuropeptides as PD diagnostic biomarkers. Integrating neuropeptide biomarkers into normal diagnostic processes can substantially enhance early diagnosis. This enables early therapeutic interventions and improves outcomes for individuals with PD.",1
39793764,Current trends in blood biomarkers detection and neuroimaging for Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and cognitive impairments. A significant challenge in managing PD is the variability of symptoms and disease progression rates. This variability is primarily attributed to unclear biomarkers associated with the disease and the lack of early diagnostic technologies and effective imaging methods. PD-specific biomarkers are essential for developing practical tools that facilitate accurate diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring of disease progression. Hence, creating valuable tools for detecting and diagnosing PD based on specific biomarkers is imperative. Blood testing, less invasive than obtaining cerebrospinal fluid through a lumbar puncture, is an ideal source for these biomarkers. Although such biomarkers were previously lacking, recent advancements in various detection techniques related to PD biomarkers and new imaging methods have emerged. However, basic research requires more detailed guidelines on effectively implementing these biomarkers in diagnostic procedures to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of PD blood testing in clinical practice. This review discusses the developmental trends of PD-related blood biomarker detection technologies, including optical analysis platforms. Despite the progress in developing various biomarkers for PD, their specificity and sensitivity remain suboptimal. Therefore, the integration of multimodal biomarkers along with optical and imaging technologies is likely to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate the implementation of personalized medicine. This review forms valid research hypotheses for PD research and guides future empirical studies.",1
39791487,Neuropsychological test performance in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We sought to characterize the cognitive profile among individuals with mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) to help guide future clinical criteria. Systematic review and meta-analysis included MCI-LB studies with cognitive data from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (January 1990 to March 2023). MCI-LB scores were compared to controls, MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) groups with random-effects models. We included 26 studies and 2823 participants. Across all domains, the MCI-LB group performed worse than controls and better than DLB. Compared to MCI-AD, the MCI-LB group performed worse in attention/processing speed (g = -0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.35, -0.12), attention/executive (g = -0.42, 95% CI: -0.56, -0.28); better in verbal immediate recall (g = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.59) and delayed memory (g = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.58). The cognitive profiles in MCI-LB and MCI-AD are consistent with established profiles in DLB and AD. Neuropsychological assessment may be helpful in differential diagnosis, even in early disease states. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis for cognition in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB). Compared to MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD), MCI-LB had worse attention, executive function, and processing speed. Compared to MCI-AD, MCI-LB had better verbal immediate and delayed recall. The MCI-LB group was worse on all cognitive domains than controls, and better than dementia with Lewy bodies. Studies used different tests and there is a need for global efforts for harmonization.",1
39789469,Do the gait domains change in PD patients with freezing of gait during their 'interictal' period?,"Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the disabling symptoms in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). While it is difficult to early detect because of the sporadic occurrence of initial freezing events. Whether the characteristic of gait impairments in PD patients with FOG during the 'interictal' period is different from that in non-FOG patients is still unclear. The gait parameters were measured by wearable inertial sensors. Exploratory factor analysis was used to investigate the inherent structure of diverse univariate gait parameters, with the aim of identifying shared characteristics among the gait variables. This cross-sectional study involved 68 controls and 245 PD patients (167 without FOG and 78 with FOG). The analysis yielded six distinct gait domains which were utilized to describe the impaired gait observed during the ""interictal"" period of FOG. Both PD-nFOG and PD-FOG groups exhibited significant impairments in the pace domain, kinematic domain, gait phase domain, and turning process domain compared to the healthy control. The gait phase domain was different in the PD-FOG group compared to the PD-nFOG group (p corrected = 0.004, Cohen's d = -0.46). And it was identified as independent risk factor for FOG (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.05-2.55, p = 0.030), as well as other risk factors: gender (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.19-5.99, p = 0.017), MDS-UPDRS IV score (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.10-1.37, p < 0.001), and PIGD subscore (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.30-1.73, p < 0.001). The model demonstrated a correct discrimination rate of 0.78 between PD-FOG and PD-nFOG, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.87. FOG was found to be associated with abnormal alterations in the gait phase domain during the interictal period.

39788336,Individualized brain radiomics-based network tracks distinct subtypes and abnormal patterns in prodromal Parkinson's disease.,"Individuals in the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit significant heterogeneity and can be divided into distinct subtypes based on clinical symptoms, pathological mechanisms, and brain network patterns. However, little has been done regarding the valid subtyping of prodromal PD, which hinders the early diagnosis of PD. Therefore, we aimed to identify the subtypes of prodromal PD using the brain radiomics-based network and examine the unique patterns linked to the clinical presentations of each subtype. Individualized brain radiomics-based network was constructed for normal controls (NC; N = 110), prodromal PD patients (N = 262), and PD patients (N = 108). A data-driven clustering approach using the radiomics-based network was carried out to cluster prodromal PD patients into higher-/lower-risk subtypes. Then, the dissociated patterns of clinical manifestations, anatomical structure alterations, and gene expression between these two subtypes were evaluated. Clustering findings indicated that one prodromal PD subtype closely resembled the pattern of NCs (N-P; N = 159), while the other was similar to the pattern of PD (P-P; N = 103). Significant differences were observed between the subtypes in terms of multiple clinical measurements, neuroimaging for morphological changes, and gene enrichment for synaptic transmission. Identification of prodromal PD subtypes based on brain connectomes and a full understanding of heterogeneity at this phase could inform early and accurate PD diagnosis and effective neuroprotective interventions.",1
39786322,Automated Detection of Isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Using Computer Vision.,"Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early stage of Parkinson's disease or related disorders. Diagnosis requires an overnight video-polysomnogram (vPSG), however, even for sleep experts, interpreting vPSG data is challenging. Using a 3D camera, automated analysis of movements has yielded high accuracy. We aimed to replicate and extend prior work using a conventional 2D camera. The dataset included 172 vPSG recordings from a clinical sleep center, 81 patients with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls (63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers). An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, from which features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility were extracted. Patients with iRBD exhibited an increased number of shorter movements and immobility periods. Accuracies for detecting iRBD ranged from 84.9% (with 2 features) to 87.2% (with 5 features). Combining all 5 features but only analyzing short (0.1-2 second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%. Of the 11 patients with iRBD without noticeable movements during vPSG, 7 were correctly identified. This work improves prior art by using a 2D camera routinely used in sleep laboratories and improving performance by adding only 3 features. This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of iRBD. Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment using conventional infrared cameras to detect and/or monitor RBD. ANN NEUROL 2025.",1

39781052,A Riemannian multimodal representation to classify parkinsonism-related patterns from noninvasive observations of gait and eye movements.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder principally manifested as motor disabilities. In clinical practice, diagnostic rating scales are available for broadly measuring, classifying, and characterizing the disease progression. Nonetheless, these scales depend on the specialist's expertise, introducing a high degree of subjectivity. Thus, diagnosis and motor stage identification may be affected by misinterpretation, leading to incorrect or misguided treatments. This work addresses how to learn multimodal representations based on compact gait and eye motion descriptors whose fusion improves disease diagnosis prediction. This work introduces a noninvasive multimodal strategy that combines gait and ocular pursuit motion modalities into a geometrical Riemannian Neural Network for PD quantification and diagnostic support. Markerless gait and ocular pursuit videos were first recorded as Parkinson's observations, which are represented at each frame by a set of frame convolutional deep features. Then, Riemannian means are computed per modality using frame-level covariances coded from convolutional deep features. Thus, a geometrical learning representation is adjusted by Riemannian means, following early, intermediate, and late fusion alternatives. The adjusted Riemannian manifold combines input modalities to obtain PD prediction. The geometrical multimodal approach was validated in a study involving 13 control subjects and 19 PD patients, achieving a mean accuracy of 96% for early and intermediate fusion and 92% for late fusion, increasing the unimodal accuracy results obtained in the gait and eye movement modalities by 6 and 8%, respectively. The proposed method was able to discriminate Parkinson's patients from healthy subjects using multimodal geometrical configurations based on covariances descriptors. The covariance representation of video descriptors is highly compact (with an input size of 625 and an output size of 256 (1 BiRe)), facilitating efficient learning with a small number of samples, a crucial aspect in medical applications.",1

39768036,Architecture-Aware Augmentation: A Hybrid Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approach for Enhanced Parkinson's Disease Detection.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Spiral drawing analysis has emerged as a non-invasive tool to detect early motor impairments associated with PD. This study examines the performance of hybrid deep learning and machine learning models in detecting PD using spiral drawings, with a focus on the impact of data augmentation techniques. We compare the accuracy of Vision Transformer (ViT) with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Residual Neural Networks (ResNet-50) with Logistic Regression, evaluating their performance on both augmented and non-augmented data. Our findings reveal that ViT with KNN, initially achieving 96.77% accuracy on unaugmented data, experienced a notable decline across all augmentation techniques, suggesting it relies heavily on global patterns in spiral drawings. In contrast, ResNet-50 with Logistic Regression showed consistent improvement with data augmentation, reaching 93.55% accuracy when rotation and flipping techniques were applied. These results highlight that hybrid models respond differently to augmentation, and careful selection of augmentation strategies is necessary for optimizing model performance. Our study provides important insights into the development of reliable diagnostic tools for early PD detection, emphasizing the need for appropriate augmentation techniques in medical image analysis.",1
39767175,Role and Diagnostic Significance of Apolipoprotein D in Selected Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The World Health Organization in 2021 ranked Alzheimer's disease and other dementias as the seventh leading cause of death globally. Neurodegenerative disorders are progressive, intractable, and often fatal diseases. Early diagnosis may allow patients to enjoy prolonged survival with attenuated symptomatology because of early intervention. Hence, further research on finding non-invasive biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases is warranted. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is a glycoprotein involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress regulation, and inflammation. It is expressed in various body fluids and regions of the central nervous system. ApoD's roles in neuroprotection, lipid transport, and anti-inflammatory processes are crucial as far as the prevention of neurodegenerative pathologies is concerned. This review aims to summarize the background knowledge on ApoD, and it covers studies indexed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. It discusses the evidence for the multifaceted roles of ApoD in the mechanisms and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. ApoD may be a specific, sensitive, easily obtained, cost-effective biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases and its applications in diagnostic practices, treatment strategies, and advancing neurodegenerative disorders' management.",1
39766465,Artificial Intelligence-Based Methodologies for Early Diagnostic Precision and Personalized Therapeutic Strategies in Neuro-Ophthalmic and Neurodegenerative Pathologies.,"Advancements in neuroimaging, particularly diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), have significantly enhanced the early detection of biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques-Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging-in identifying subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense. This review underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to validate, standardize, and implement these technologies to maximize their clinical impact.",1

We dissect the complex landscape of PD-related psychiatric symptoms, taking into account the impact of functional neurological disorders, somatic delusions, impulse control disorders, and conditions within the bipolar spectrum. The newer entities of somatoform and functional neurological disorders, as well as preexisting bipolar spectrum disorders, are analyzed in detail. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a holistic understanding of PD, wherein the cognitive and psychiatric dimensions are valued alongside motor symptoms. Such an approach aims to facilitate early detection and personalized interventions, and enhance the overall quality of life for individuals suffering from this neurodegenerative disorder.",1
39764409,Optical detection of the spatial structural alteration in the human brain tissues/cells and DNA/chromatin due to Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered one of the most frequent neurological diseases in the world. There is a need to study the early and efficient biomarkers of Parkinson's, such as changes in structural disorders like DNA/chromatin, especially at the subcellular level in the human brain. We used two techniques, Partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect the changes in structural disorder in the human brain tissue samples. It was observed from the PWS experiment that there was an increase in structural disorder in Parkinson's disease tissues/cells when compared to normal tissues/cells using mesoscopic light transport theory. Furthermore, the IPR experiment also showed DNA/chromatin structural alterations that have the same trend and support the PWS results. The increase in mass density in the nuclei components, such as DNA/chromatin, can be linked to the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the substantia nigra of the brain. This protein deposition is considered a significant cause of neuronal death in the brains of PD patients. We also did a histological analysis of brain tissues, which supports our results from dual photonics techniques. The results show that this dual technique is a powerful approach to detect the changes. Our results highlight the potential of the parameter, related to the structural disorder strength, as an efficient biomarker for PD progress, paving the way for research into early disease detection.",1
39764292,"Commercial symptom monitoring devices in Parkinson's disease: benefits, limitations, and trends.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Managing PD requires accurate assessment of motor and non-motor symptoms, often complicated by the subjectivity in symptom reporting and the limited availability of neurologists. To address these challenges, commercial wearable devices have emerged to continuously monitor PD symptoms outside the clinical setting. The main devices include PKG™, Kinesia 360™, Kinesia U™, PDMonitor™, and STAT-ON™. These devices utilize advanced technologies such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and specific algorithms to provide objective data on motor symptoms like tremors, dyskinesia, and bradykinesia. Despite their potential, the adoption of these devices is limited due to concerns about their accuracy, complexity of use, and lack of independent validation. The correlation between these devices' measurements and traditional clinical observations varies, and patient usability and adherence remain critical areas for improvement.

39764149,A novel multi-level 3D pose estimation framework for gait detection of Parkinson's disease using monocular video.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by muscle stiffness, bradykinesia, and balance disorders, significantly impairing the quality of life for affected patients. While motion pose estimation and gait analysis can aid in early diagnosis and timely intervention, clinical practice currently lacks objective and accurate tools for gait analysis. This study proposes a multi-level 3D pose estimation framework for PD patients, integrating monocular video with Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) techniques. Gait temporal and spatial parameters were extracted and verified for 59 healthy elderly and PD patients, and an early prediction model for PD patients was established. The repeatability of the gait parameters showed strong consistency, with most of the estimated parameters yielding an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) greater than 0.70. Furthermore, these parameters exhibited a high correlation with VICON and ATMI results ( The proposed 3D pose estimation method demonstrates high reliability and effectiveness in providing accurate 3D human pose parameters, with strong potential for early prediction of PD. This markerless method offers significant advantages in terms of low cost, portability, and ease of use, positioning it as a promising tool for monitoring and screening PD patients in clinical settings.",1
39763110,Porous Materials for Early Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, present formidable challenges in modern medicine due to their complex pathologies and the absence of curative treatments. Despite advances in symptomatic management, early diagnosis remains essential for mitigating disease progression and improving patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as MRI, PET, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, are often inadequate for the early detection of these diseases. Emerging porous materials, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), MXene, zeolites, and porous silicon, offer promising new approaches for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. These materials, characterized by highly tunable physicochemical properties, have the potential to capture and concentrate disease-specific biomarkers such as amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau protein, and alpha-synuclein (α-Syn). The integration of these materials into advanced biosensors for real-time detection holds the promise of revolutionizing neurodiagnostic, enabling non-invasive, highly sensitive, and specific detection platforms. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques into the analysis of sensor data enhances diagnostic accuracy and allows for more efficient interpretation of complex biomarker profiles. AI and ML can optimize feature selection, improve pattern recognition, and facilitate the prediction of disease progression, making them indispensable tools for personalized medicine. This review explores the potential of porous materials in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics, emphasizing their design, functionality, and the synergistic role of AI and ML in advancing clinical applications.",1
39760833,Advancing Parkinson's diagnosis: seed amplification assay for α-synuclein detection in minimally invasive samples.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, beginning with early loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral substantia nigra and advancing to broader neurodegeneration in the midbrain. The clinical heterogeneity of PD and the lack of specific diagnostic tests present significant challenges, highlighting the need for reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis. Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn), a protein aggregating into Lewy bodies and neurites in PD patients, has emerged as a key biomarker due to its central role in PD pathophysiology and potential to reflect pathological processes. Additionally, α-Syn allows earlier differentiation between PD and other neurodegenerative disorders with similar symptoms. Currently, detection of α-Syn pathology in post-mortem brain tissue remains the primary means of achieving a conclusive diagnosis, often revealing significant misdiagnoses. Seed amplification assay (SAA), initially developed for prion diseases, has been adapted to detect α-Syn aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid, showing promise for early diagnosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that SAA can also detect α-Syn aggregates in peripheral samples collected via minimally invasive procedures, such as skin, olfactory mucosa, saliva, and blood. However, the lack of standardized protocols limits clinical application. Standardizing protocols is essential to improve assay reliability and enable accurate patient identification for emerging therapies. This review examines studies on SAA for detecting α-Syn aggregates in minimally invasive samples, focusing on sample collection, processing, and reaction conditions.",1
39760532,Use of Robust Norming to Create a Sensitive Cognitive Summary Score in De Novo Parkinson's Disease: An Illustrative Example.,"Cognitive impairment is common at all stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is no consensus on which neuropsychological tests to use or how to interpret cognitive battery results. A cognitive summary score (CSS) combines the richness of a neuropsychological battery with the simplicity of a single score. The objective of this study was to determine whether a CSS created using robust norming can detect early cognitive deficits in de novo, untreated PD. Baseline cognitive data from PD participants and healthy control participants (HCs) in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were used to (1) create a robust HC subgroup without cognitive decline, (2) generate regression-based z scores for six cognitive measures using this subgroup, and (3) create a CSS by averaging all z scores. PD participants scored worse than HCs on all cognitive tests, with larger effects when compared with the robust HC subgroup rather than all HCs. Applying internally derived norms, the largest effects were for processing speed/working memory (Cohen's d = -0.55) and verbal episodic memory (Cohen's d = -0.48 and -0.52). Robust norming shifted PD performance from average (CSS z score = -0.01) to low average (CSS z score = -0.40), with a larger effect for the CSS (PD vs. robust HC subgroup; Cohen's d = -0.60) compared with individual tests. Patients with PD perform worse cognitively than HCs, particularly in processing speed and verbal memory. Robust norming increases effect sizes and decreases PD scores to expected levels. The CSS outperformed individual tests and may detect cognitive changes in early PD, making it a useful outcome measure in clinical research. © 2025 The Author(s).

39760477,Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number as a Potential Biomarker for the Severity of Motor Symptoms and Prognosis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Mitochondrial function influences Parkinson's disease (PD) through the accumulation of pathogenic alpha-synuclein, oxidative stress, impaired autophagy, and neuroinflammation. The mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), representing the number of mitochondrial DNA copies within a cell, serves as an easily assessable proxy for mitochondrial function. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of mtDNA-CN in PD. We assessed mtDNA-CN in blood samples using whole genome sequencing from 405 patients with PD and 200 healthy controls (HC). We examined the relationship between mtDNA-CN levels and motor symptom severity in PD, as well as their association with dementia development in patients with early-PD (within 3 years of diagnosis). mtDNA-CN levels were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with HC (P = 1.1 × 10 Our findings suggest that blood mtDNA-CN may function as a diagnostic biomarker for PD and a prognostic marker for dementia in patients with PD. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",1

To determine the clinical utility of F-DOPA PET in an Australian movement disorder clinic setting. Retrospective cohort study of movement disorder clinic patients referred for F-DOPA PET by four movement disorder neurologists over a 10-year period to a single Australian nuclear medicine centre. Results of F-DOPA PET scans were correlated with changes in provisional diagnosis and management in the short term following review of F-DOPA PET results. A total of 105 F-DOPA PET scan results and patient records were examined. In this cohort, provisional clinical diagnosis was altered in 37.9% of patients, and changes to clinical management were made in 48.4% of patients in the short term following review of F-DOPA PET results. Changes in both diagnosis and management were more common following a normal F-DOPA PET scan result (42.4% and 53.0% respectively) than a scan consistent with iPD (23.5% and 32.4% respectively). There was significant change in provisional clinical diagnosis and management in the short term following review of F-DOPA PET results indicating significant clinical utility of F-DOPA PET in the Australian movement disorder clinic setting.",1
39757803,Surface Engineered Nanoparticles Coupled with Pattern Recognition Techniques for Rapid Identification and Discrimination of Multiple Thiols in a Real Sample Matrix.,"Thiols, including Cysteine (CYS) and Glutathione (GSH), play pivotal roles in numerous physiological processes as they are integral components of many essential biomolecules and are found abundantly in foods such as additives and antioxidants. Any deviations in thiol concentrations can disrupt normal physiological functions, affecting the body's metabolism and potentially leading to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, etc. Consequently, the imperative need for developing reliable and robust techniques for thiol analysis is crucial for early disease detection and ensuring food safety. In this regard, we have decorated the surface of organic nanoparticles with metal ions, which have been characterized using various techniques such as Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Zeta potential, Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and utilized for the detection and discrimination of various thiols (cysteine, Glutathione, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, 2-mercapto ethanol, and cysteamine). Photophysical results revealed that various thiols exhibit unique binding affinities toward sensor elements, serving as fingerprints for each thiol. These patterns can be quantitatively differentiated using linear discrimination analysis (LDA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). The sensor array effectively discriminates target thiols with 100% accuracy and high sensitivity with limit of detection values from 1.19 to 4.20 μM.

We describe a case of a patient in their 40s presenting with 48 hours of persistent headache following intrathecal administration of nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 3. There were no focal neurological signs or symptoms apart from baseline symmetrical proximal limb weakness attributed to SMA. Initial investigations revealed radiological evidence of an acute cerebral venous sinus thrombus (CVST). The patient was promptly started on anticoagulation. Partial recanalisation was seen as soon as 48 hours after commencement of anticoagulation, with almost full resolution of the thrombus at follow-up in 2 months.

To identify the most bothersome symptoms experienced by people with early PD, leveraging data from the Parkinson's Disease Patient Report of Problems (PD-PROP) questionnaire within the Fox Insight Study. Individuals with a self-reported diagnosis of PD completed the PD-PROP questionnaire, reporting up to five most bothersome symptoms. Symptom types and frequencies were derived through a combination of human expertise and machine learning. Participants (N = 8536) were 0.9 years since diagnosis, predominantly white (96%), male (53.3%), and with an average age of 64.6 years. Top most bothersome motor symptoms were tremor (55.9%) and gait issues (36.7%). Top most bothersome non-motor symptoms were pain/discomfort (33.1%) and physical fatigue (27.5%).

39752461,Parkinson's disease screening using a fusion of gait point cloud and silhouette features.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is often accompanied by slowness of movement (bradykinesia) or gradual reduction in the frequency and amplitude of repetitive movement (hypokinesia). There is currently no cure for PD, but early detection and treatment can slow down its progression and lead to better treatment outcomes. Vision-based approaches have been proposed for the early detection of PD using gait. Gait can be captured using appearance-based or model-based approaches. Although appearance-based gait contains comprehensive features, it is easily affected by factors such as dressing. On the other hand, model-based gait is robust against changes in dressing and external contours, but it is often too sparse to contain sufficient information. Therefore, we propose a fusion of appearance-based and model-based gait features for PD prediction. First, we extracted keypoint coordinates from gait captured in videos and modeled these keypoints as a point cloud. The silhouette images are also segmented from the videos to obtain an overall appearance representation of the subject. We then perform a binary classification of gait as normal or Parkinsonian using a novel fusion of the gait point cloud and silhouette features, obtaining AUC up to 0.87 and F1-Scores up to 0.82 (precision: 0.85, recall: 0.80).",1
39751989,Associations between frailty and cognitive impairment in Parkinson´s disease: a cross-sectional study.,"The presence of frailty is common in people with Parkinson's disease, as is cognitive dysfunction. Previous research on frailty has focused on the physical aspects of the pathology. To analyze the relationship between frailty and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease and to know which disease characteristics are associated with frailty. An observational, correlational and cross-sectional study was conducted. Participants were recruited from a Home Rehabilitation Service and two Parkinson's Associations. An individualized assessment was carried out by means of a structured interview. Frailty was assessed with the Fried scale and cognitive function with the Mini Mental State Examination and the Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale. 90 patients were recruited, 60% men, with a mean age of 73.50 (6.71) years. Frailty was associated with age and disease severity (p < 0.05). Frail patients presented worse cognitive performance relative to pre-frail and robust patients. A negative correlation (coefficient - 0.503) was observed between frailty and measures of patients' cognitive function (p < 0.05). The coexistence of frailty and cognitive impairment should be assessed, as PD patients with both conditions are more vulnerable and have a higher chance of experiencing adverse effects. Frail patients with Parkinson's disease present an impairment of cognitive functions dependent on cortical and subcortical regions, being these regions more preserved in the case of robust. The development of programs for early detection of frailty and cognitive function in these patients is necessary to implement strategic intervention plans focused on reversing frailty and cognitive impairment.

39747956,Gait-based Parkinson's disease diagnosis and severity classification using force sensors and machine learning.,"A dual-stage model for classifying Parkinson's disease severity, through a detailed analysis of Gait signals using force sensors and machine learning approaches, is proposed in this study. Parkinson's disease is the primary neurodegenerative disorder that results in a gradual reduction in motor function. Early detection and monitoring of the disease progression is highly challenging due to the gradual progression of symptoms and the inadequacy of conventional methods in identifying subtle changes in mobility. The proposed dual-stage model utilized a hypertuned Random Forest Tree (RFT) to classify the subjects into PD and non-PD classes at Stage 1 and a hypertuned Ensemble Regressor (ER) to predict the severity of illness at Stage 2. Further, we have implemented the proposed model on the data signals gathered from both feet of 166 participants using Vertical Ground Reaction Force Sensors (VGRF). The dataset comprised 93 persons with Parkinson's disease and 73 healthy controls. The dataset (imbalance) collected from both feet is passed to the preprocessing phase (for balancing data using the SMOTE method), followed by the feature extraction phase to extract features related to time, frequency, spatial, and temporal features domains that are highly effective for detecting and assigning severity levels of PD. A Recursive Feature Elimination method is also used to select the optimal set of features to improve the model performance. It is acknowledged that the early detection of Parkinson's disease is contingent upon critical parameters, including stride length, stance duration, swing interval, double limb support, step time, and step length. The crucial evaluation metrics used for evaluating model performance include accuracy, mean absolute error, and root mean square error. The findings indicate that the suggested model significantly surpasses current methodologies. It attained an accuracy of 97.5 ± 2.1%, Sensitivity of 97% ± 2.5%, and average Specificity of 95% ± 2.2% in differentiating between PD and non-PD participants utilizing RFT and evaluated disease severity with an average accuracy of 96.4 ± 2.3%, an average mean absolute error of 0.065 ± 0.024, and a root mean square error of 0.080 ± 0.06. The results indicate that the proposed dual-stage model is exceptionally successful in the early detection and severity assessment of Parkinson's disease and demonstrates better efficacy than alternative models.",1
39747207,Machine learning for early detection and severity classification in people with Parkinson's disease.,"Early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) and accurate assessment of disease progression are critical for optimizing treatment and rehabilitation. However, there is no consensus on how to effectively detect early-stage PD and classify motor symptom severity using gait analysis. This study evaluated the accuracy of machine learning models in classifying early and moderate-stages of PD based on spatiotemporal gait features at different walking speeds. A total of 178 participants were recruited, including 103 individuals with PD (61 early-stage, 42 moderate-stage) and 75 healthy controls. Participants performed a walking test on a 24-m walkway at three speeds: preferred walking speed (PWS), 20% faster (HWS), and 20% slower (LWS). Key features-walking speed at PWS, stride length at HWS, and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the stride length at LWS-achieved a classification accuracy of 78.1% using the random forest algorithm. For early PD detection, the stride length at HWS and CV of the stride length at LWS provided an accuracy of 67.3% with Naïve Bayes. Walking at PWS was the most critical feature for distinguishing early from moderate PD, with an accuracy of 69.8%. These findings suggest that assessing gait over consecutive steps under different speed conditions may improve the early detection and severity assessment of individuals with PD.",1
39742406,[Peculiarities of the time of manifestation of a number of diseases in the periods before and after the COVID-19 pandemic according to the data of municipal polyclinics of Sakhalin region.].,"The topic of the timing of the manifestation of age-associated diseases (as an indirect indicator of accelerated population aging) after the transfer of COVID-19 remains an urgent area in scientific research. Early targeted diagnosis can significantly reduce the consequences of pathology, in connection with which the features of the manifestation of various nosologies in the post-COVID period were studied. The materials were the accounting and statistical data of the municipal polyclinics of the Sakhalin Region for the pre-COVID (2017-2019) and post-COVID (2022-2023) periods. The median age of newly diagnosed patients and the age-specific incidence index were analyzed for the following nosologies: hypertensive diseases, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, senile cataracts, and Parkinson's disease. There was a «rejuvenation» of the timing of the manifestation of the disease in the post-COVID period. Meanwhile, the decrease in the median age of disease manifestation was uneven: the most pronounced «rejuvenation» was characteristic of hypertensive diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and coronary heart disease. The order of manifestation of the considered nosologies was maintained in both observation periods. This circumstance is confirmed by both the median age of patients and the age-specific incidence index.

Ранняя прицельная диагностика способна существенно снизить последствия патологии, в связи с чем были изучены особенности манифестации различных нозологических форм в постковидном периоде. В качестве материалов выступили учетно-статистические данные муниципальных поликлиник Сахалинской обл. за доковидный (2017–2019) и постковидный (2022–2023) периоды. Проводили анализ медианного возраста пациентов с впервые установленным диагнозом и значений возрастного индекса заболеваемости по следующим нозологическим формам: болезни, характеризующиеся повышенным кровяным давлением; ИБС; сахарный диабет 2-го типа; глаукома; старческая катаракта и болезнь Паркинсона. Установлено «омоложение» сроков манифестации заболевания в периоде после пандемии. Между тем, снижение медианного возраста манифестации заболеваний происходило неравномерно: наиболее выраженное «омоложение» было характерно для болезней, характеризующихся повышенным кровяным давлением, сахарного диабета 2-го типа, глаукомы и ИБС. Очередность манифестации рассмотренных нозологических форм сохранялась в обоих периодах наблюдения. Данное обстоятельство подтверждается как медианным возрастом пациентов, так и возрастным индексом заболеваемости.",1
39739484,Determination of High-Sensitivity C-reactive protein in Patient with Early Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. The pathogenesis of PD is unknown till now. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific biochemical marker of inflammation. It is used for the screening of organ diseases and the monitoring of responses to treatment in cases of inflammation and infection. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in early Parkinson disease. A total of seventy-six early Parkinson's disease patients were enrolled in this Cross-sectional observational study which was carried out in the Department of Neurology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh from September 2014 to March 2016. We assessed high sensitivity CRP of early Parkinson's disease patients as an inflammatory marker. This study was performed with 76 early Parkinson disease patients. Among them, male and female were 69.7% and 30.3% respectively. The mean ±SD age of patients was 53.25±11.53 years with an age range of 24 to 77 years. The mean ±SD value of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was estimated 2.76±3.57 mg/L with the range of 0.21 to 20.90mg/L. We also calculate the 95% CI in the range of 1.96 to 3.56mg/L. Also, a positive and highly significant correlation were seen in between duration of tremor and High sensitivity CRP (r=0.430, p<0.001) and between duration of bradykinesia and High sensitivity CRP (r=0.426, p<0.001) which indicate increase duration causes increase level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein value. In conclusion, above findings suggests that neuro-inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of early Parkinson's disease progression.",1
39739129,A cross-language speech model for detection of Parkinson's disease.,"Speech change is a biometric marker for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, evaluating speech variability across diverse languages is challenging. We aimed to develop a cross-language algorithm differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls using a Taiwanese and Korean speech data set. We recruited 299 healthy controls and 347 patients with PD from Taiwan and Korea. Participants with PD underwent smartphone-based speech recordings during the ""on"" phase. Each Korean participant performed various speech texts, while the Taiwanese participant read a standardized, fixed-length article. Korean short-speech (≦15 syllables) and long-speech (> 15 syllables) recordings were combined with the Taiwanese speech dataset. The merged dataset was split into a training set (controls vs. early-stage PD) and a validation set (controls vs. advanced-stage PD) to evaluate the model's effectiveness in differentiating PD patients from controls across languages based on speech length. Numerous acoustic and linguistic speech features were extracted and combined with machine learning algorithms to distinguish PD patients from controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated to assess diagnostic performance. Random forest and AdaBoost classifiers showed an AUROC 0.82 for distinguishing patients with early-stage PD from controls. In the validation cohort, the random forest algorithm maintained this value (0.90) for discriminating advanced-stage PD patients. The model showed superior performance in the combined language cohort (AUROC 0.90) than either the Korean (AUROC 0.87) or Taiwanese (AUROC 0.88) cohorts individually. However, with another merged speech data set of short-speech recordings < 25 characters, the diagnostic performance to identify early-stage PD patients from controls dropped to 0.72 and showed a further limited ability to discriminate advanced-stage patients. Leveraging multifaceted speech features, including both acoustic and linguistic characteristics, could aid in distinguishing PD patients from healthy individuals, even across different languages.",1
39737769,"Insights Into Retinal Pathologies in Neurological Disorders: A Focus on Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Alzheimer's Disease.","Neurological diseases are central nervous system (CNS) disorders affecting the whole body. Early diagnosis of the diseases is difficult due to the lack of disease-specific tests. Adding new biomarkers external to the CNS facilitates the diagnosis of neurological diseases. In this respect, the retina has a common embryologic origin with the CNS. Retinal imaging technologies including optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used in the understanding and processual monitoring of neurological diseases. Retinal imaging has been recently recognized as a potential source of biomarkers for neurological diseases, increasing the number of studies in this direction. In this review, the association of retinal abnormalities with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained. Structural and functional abnormalities in retina as a predictive marker may facilitate early diagnosis of diseases. Although not all retinal abnormalities are predictive of neurologic diseases, changes in the retinal layers including retinal pigment epithelium and plexiform layers should suggest the risk of PD, MS, ALS, and AD.",1
39734199,A robust Parkinson's disease detection model based on time-varying synaptic efficacy function in spiking neural network.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people around the world. Conventional PD detection algorithms are generally based on first and second-generation artificial neural network (ANN) models which consume high energy and have complex architecture. Considering these limitations, a time-varying synaptic efficacy function based leaky-integrate and fire neuron model, called SEFRON is used for the detection of PD. SEFRON explores the advantages of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) which is suitable for neuromorphic devices. To evaluate the performance of SEFRON, 2 publicly available standard datasets, namely (1) UCI: Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset and (2) UCI: Parkinson Dataset with replicated acoustic features are used. The performance is compared with other well-known neural network models: Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). The experimental results demonstrate that the SEFRON classifier achieves a maximum accuracy of 100% and an average accuracy of 99.49% on dataset 1. For dataset 2, it attains a peak accuracy of 94% and an average accuracy of 91.94%, outperforming the other classifiers in both cases. From the performance, it is proved that the presented model can help to develop a robust automated PD detection device that can assist the physicians to diagnose the disease at its early stage.",1
39732824,Concordance and test-retest consistency of sleep biomarker-based neurodegenerative disorder profiling.,"Biomarkers that aid in early detection of neurodegeneration are needed to enable early symptomatic treatment and enable identification of people who may benefit from neuroprotective interventions. Increasing evidence suggests that sleep biomarkers may be useful, given the bi-directional relationship between sleep and neurodegeneration and the prominence of sleep disturbances and altered sleep architectural characteristics in several neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to demonstrate that sleep can accurately characterize specific neurodegenerative disorders (NDD). A four-class machine-learning algorithm was trained using age and nine sleep biomarkers from patients with clinically-diagnosed manifest and prodromal NDDs, including Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD = 27), Lewy body dementia (LBD = 18), and isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD = 15), as well as a control group (CG = 58). The algorithm was validated in a total of 381 recordings, which included the training data set plus an additional AD = 10, iRBD = 18, Parkinson disease without dementia (PD = 29), mild cognitive impairment (MCI = 78) and CG = 128. Test-retest consistency was then assessed in LBD = 10, AD = 9, and CG = 46. The agreement between the NDD profiles and their respective clinical diagnoses exceeded 75% for the AD, LBD, and CG, and improved when NDD participants classified Likely Normal with NDD indications consistent with their clinical diagnosis were considered. Profiles for iRBD, PD and MCI participants were consistent with the heterogeneity of disease severities, with the majority of overt disagreements explained by normal sleep characterization in 27% of iRBD, 21% of PD, and 26% of MCI participants. For test-retest assignments, the same or similar NDD profiles were obtained for 88% of LBD, 86% in AD, and 98% of CG participants. The potential utility for NDD subtyping based on sleep biomarkers demonstrates promise and requires further prospective development and validation in larger NDD cohorts.",1
39731299,Prediction of phenoconversion into alpha-synucleinopathy in patients with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder using event-related potentials during visuospatial attention tasks.,"Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is recognized as a prodromal stage of alpha-synucleinopathies. Predicting phenoconversion in iRBD patients remains a key challenge. We aimed to investigate whether event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during visuospatial attention tasks can serve as predictors of phenoconversion in iRBD patients. We conducted a longitudinal study with 126 iRBD patients (aged 67.1 ± 6.4, 77 males) and 41 healthy controls (aged 66.1 ± 6.9, 29 males). Among the patients, those who further developed synucleinopathies during the follow-up period (average 6.3 years) were classified as converters (iRBD-CV), while the others were non-converters (iRBD-NC). Posner's visuospatial cueing task was performed at baseline. The N2 and P3 components were acquired for both the cue and target (valid and invalid) stimuli. Based on group comparisons, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Twenty-nine patients converted to alpha-synucleinopathies (aged 69.4 ± 7.1, 14 males). iRBD patients exhibited overall reductions in N2 components for cue, valid, and invalid stimuli compared to HC (p = 0.012, 0.047, and 0.001, respectively). iRBD-CV patients displayed a significant increase in cue-elicited P3 (p < 0.001) and a decreasing trend in cue-elicited N2 (p = 0.079) compared to iRBD-NC. These ERP alterations were strongly associated with faster rate of phenoconversion (p < 0.001 for both components). Our findings suggest that altered cue-elicited ERPs could serve as early biomarkers for predicting phenoconversion in iRBD patients, likely reflecting attention-related neurodegeneration pathways. These biomarkers potentially enable the detection of preclinical phenotypes in alpha-synucleinopathies, facilitating timely intervention.",1
39730770,Infectious intestinal diseases elevate neurodegenerative disease risk based on a nationwide population-based cohort study.,"Infectious intestinal diseases (IIDs) pose a significant health and economic burden worldwide. Recent observations at the Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan, suggest a potential association between IIDs and neurodegenerative diseases, prompting an investigation into this relationship. This study explored interactions between IIDs and neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort analysis using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. Patients diagnosed with IIDs between 2000 and 2015 were identified along with a matched control group. Covariates, including demographics, comorbidities, and healthcare utilization were considered. The hazard ratios (HRs) of neurodegenerative diseases were assessed using a Cox proportional regression analysis. This study included 297,438 patients: 99,146 and 198,292 patients in the IID and control groups, respectively. Patients with IIDs showed a significantly higher overall risk of neurodegenerative diseases (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.144, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed an elevated risk of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegeneration-associated disorders in the study group. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between the frequency of medical visits for IIDs and neurodegenerative disease risk. This study provides evidence for a significant association between IIDs and the neurodegenerative disease risk. Early detection and management of IIDs may have implications for long-term neurological health outcomes. Further research is required to elucidate underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions and preventive strategies.",1
39730076,Autophagic signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Parkinson's disease patients.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments and the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein. Dysregulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), responsible for degrading misfolded proteins, has been implicated in PD pathogenesis. However, current diagnostic approaches rely heavily on motor symptoms, which occur due to substantial neurodegeneration, limiting early detection and intervention. This study investigated the potential of ALP-associated proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage PD. Quantitative analysis revealed a significant reduction in optineurin levels in PBMCs from PD patients, and the expression levels of various ALP-associated proteins were tightly correlated, suggesting a coordinated dysregulation of the pathway. Correlation analyses revealed associations between ALP-associated features and clinical characteristics, such as age of onset and motor impairment. Furthermore, the study identified multiple positive correlations among ALP-associated proteins and functional readouts, highlighting the interconnectivity within the pathway. Notably, a PBMC biomarker model incorporating lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 and optineurin exhibited high diagnostic accuracy (86%) in distinguishing PD patients from controls. These findings highlight the potential of ALP-associated protein signatures in PBMCs as novel diagnostic biomarkers for early detection and intervention in PD, offering insights into the systemic manifestations of the disease.",1
39729788,Association between vestibular evoked myogenic potentials and different dizziness status in Parkinson's disease: A controlled study.,"This study compared ocular and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP and cVEMP) among individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dizziness, with nonspecific dizziness (dizziness without orthostatic hypotension), or with dizziness combined with orthostatic hypotension. We prospectively analyzed 30 of each of the three types of individuals who were admitted to Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China) between June 2022 and April 2023. The three groups received oVEMP and cVEMP measurements using an electromyography-evoked potential system. For oVEMP, the N10 latency, P16 latency, and amplitude were compared between the three groups and the reference values. For cVEMP, the P13 latency, N23 latency, and amplitude were compared between the three groups and the reference values. Overall characteristics of oVEMP and cVEMP were also assessed using a previously published scoring scale originally developed for individuals with multiple sclerosis between the three groups included. The correlation between VEMP parameters (the latency and amplitude) and VEMP scores were simultaneously analyzed using Pearson's bivariate correlation analysis. When compared with reference values, the oVEMP and cVEMP parameters of all three groups were found to be slightly different from the reference values. When the three groups included were compared with each other, in terms of oVEMP, the average amplitude in the left eye was significantly higher in those with nonspecific dizziness than in the other two groups. In terms of cVEMP, the average N23 latency on both the right and left sides of the neck and average amplitude on the right side of the neck were significantly higher in those with nonspecific dizziness than in the other two groups. Scores for oVEMP and cVEMP were also significantly higher for those with nonspecific dizziness than for the other two groups. There were no significant differences in oVEMP and cVEMP parameters, and scores for oVEMP and cVEMP between patients with dizziness combined with orthostatic hypotension and those without dizziness. In terms of correlation analysis, the N23 latency of left neck (r = 0.509, p < 0.001), the N23 latency of right neck (r = 0.495, p < 0.001), and the amplitude of right neck (r = 0.304, p = 0.004) correlated positively with cVEMP score. Patients with PD without dizziness, with dizziness attributable to orthostatic hypotension, and with nonspecific dizziness may be all associated with vestibular dysfunction. The VEMP scores were highest in patients with nonspecific dizziness, so vestibular function is more severely affected in patients with nonspecific dizziness. The VEMP especially cVEMP may be useful for early diagnosis of nonspecific dizziness in PD.",1
39729132,Differences in Blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid Between Parkinson's Disease and Related Diseases.,"It is difficult to distinguish Parkinson's disease (PD) in the early stage from those of various disorders including atypical Parkinson's syndrome (APS), vascular parkinsonism (VP), and even essential tremor (ET), because of the overlap of symptoms. Other, more challenging problems will arise when Parkinson's disease develops into Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) in the middle and late stages. At this time, the differential diagnosis of PDD and DLB becomes thorny. These complicate the diagnostic process for PD, which traditionally heavily relies on symptomatic assessment and treatment response. Recent advances have identified several biomarkers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), including α-synuclein, lysosomal enzymes, fatty acid-binding proteins, and neurofilament light chain, whose concentration differs in PD and the related diseases. However, not all these molecules can effectively discriminate PD from related disorders. This review advocates for a paradigm shift toward biomarker-based diagnosis to effectively distinguish between PD and similar conditions. These biomarkers may reflect the diversity that exist among different diseases and provide an effective way to accurately understand their mechanisms. This review focused on blood and CSF biomarkers of PD that may have differential diagnostic value and the related molecular measurement methods with high diagnostic performance due to emerging technologies.",1
39726015,N-terminus α-synuclein detection reveals new and more diverse aggregate morphologies in multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are classified as α-synucleinopathies and are primarily differentiated by their clinical phenotypes. Delineating these diseases based on their specific α-synuclein (α-Syn) proteoform pathologies is crucial for accurate antemortem biomarker diagnosis. Newly identified α-Syn pathologies in PD raise questions about whether MSA exhibits a similar diversity. This prompted the need for a comparative study focusing on α-Syn epitope-specific immunoreactivities in both diseases, which could clarify the extent of pathological overlap and diversity, and guide more accurate biomarker development. We utilised a multiplex immunohistochemical approach to detect multiple structural domains of α-Syn proteoforms across multiple regions prone to pathological accumulation in MSA (n = 10) and PD (n = 10). Comparison of epitope-specific α-Syn proteoforms was performed in the MSA medulla, inferior olivary nucleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and in the PD olfactory bulb, medulla, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. N-terminus and C-terminus antibodies detected significantly more α-Syn pathology in MSA than antibodies for phosphorylated (pS129) α-Syn, which are classically used to detect α-Syn. Importantly, C-terminus immunolabelling is more pronounced in MSA compared to PD. Meanwhile, N-terminus immunolabelling consistently detected the highest percentage of α-Syn across pathologically burdened regions of both diseases, which could be of biological significance. As expected, oligodendroglial involvement distinguished MSA from PD, but in contrast to PD, no substantial astrocytic or microglial α-Syn accumulation in MSA occurred. These data confirm glial-specific changes between these diseases when immunolabelling the N-terminus epitope. In comparison, N-terminus neuronal α-Syn was present in PD and MSA, with most MSA neurons lacking pS129 α-Syn proteoforms. This explains why characterisation of neuronal MSA pathologies is lacking and challenges the reliance on pS129 antibodies for the accurate quantification of α-Syn pathological load across α-synucleinopathies. These findings underscore the necessity of utilising a multiplex approach to detect α-Syn, most importantly including the N-terminus, to capture the entire spectrum of α-Syn proteoforms in α-synucleinopathies. The data provide novel insights toward the biological differentiation of these α-synucleinopathies and pave the way for more refined antemortem diagnostic methods to facilitate early identification and intervention of these neurodegenerative diseases.",1
39724321,Utilizing combined quantitative multiparametric MRI as potential biomarkers for improved early-stage parkinson's disease diagnosis.,"Identifying Parkinson's disease (PD) during its initial phases presents considerable hurdles for clinicians. To examine the feasibility and efficacy of a machine learning model based on quantitative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in identifying early-stage PD. We recruited 33 participants, including 19 with early-stage PD, 14 with advanced-stage PD and 20 healthy control subjects. Each participant underwent both quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). We utilized combined QSM and DKI features to establish a support vector machine (SVM) model to identify early-stage PD. When comparing early-stage PD with healthy controls, the SVM model exhibited moderate performance, achieving a training set accuracy of 0.78 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90, and the accuracy of 0.77 (AUC = 0.87) in the test set. When comparing advanced-stage PD with healthy controls, the SVM model exhibited equally high accuracy in both training (0.97, AUC = 0.97) and test (0.94, AUC = 0.94) sets. In discriminating between early-stage PD and advanced-stage PD, the SVM model achieved an accuracy of 0.80 (AUC = 0.81) in the training set and an accuracy of 0.71 (AUC = 0.72) in the test set. The mean kurtosis feature of DKI in the substantia nigra, played a significant role in classification. These findings suggest that early PD is associated with specific MRI features reflecting magnetic susceptibility and microstructural changes. The SVM model combining quantitative QSM and DKI features holds promise for improving early PD diagnosis.",1
39721933,Structural and functional connectomics of the olfactory system in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.,"Olfactory dysfunction, affecting 75-90 % of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, holds significant predictive value for PD development. Advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), offer insights into structural and functional changes within olfactory pathways. This review summarizes a decade of research on MRI-based connectivity of the olfactory system in PD, focusing on structural and functional alterations in olfactory brain areas and their links to early olfactory processing changes. Fifteen dMRI and eighteen fMRI studies met inclusion criteria and were carefully reviewed. Among the studies investigating diffusion metrics, the most consistent finding was the reduction of fractional anisotropy in the olfactory tract and anterior olfactory structures, though evidence correlating this result to olfactory dysfunction is limited and contrasting. dMRI support the hypothesis that olfactory function may be correlated to structural alterations at the network-level. In contrast, fMRI studies found more consistent evidence of dysconnectivity in both primary and secondary olfactory areas as directly correlated to olfactory processing and dysfunction. Results suggest a potential dissociation between structural alterations in olfactory brain regions and early functional impairment in olfactory processing, likely related to different patient subtypes. Heterogeneity in clinical and technical factors may limit the generalizability of the results, leaving room for further investigations. By providing a comprehensive perspective on the use of dMRI and fMRI to explore the olfactory connectome in PD, our review might facilitate future research towards earlier diagnosis and more targeted therapeutic and neurorehabilitation strategies.",1
39719198,Striatal-cortical dysconnectivity underlies somatosensory deficits in Parkinson's disease: Insights from rhythmic auditory-motor training.,"Evidence indicates that neurodegenerative diseases spread through distinct brain networks. For Parkinson's disease (PD), somatosensory abnormalities may accompany motor dysfunction in early disease stages when dopaminergic degeneration is limited to the basal ganglia. It remains unclear whether, based on the network-spread account, these abnormalities emanated from aberrant functional connectivity with the basal ganglia, and whether interventions normalizing this connectivity could reverse these abnormalities. Here, we employed functional MRI to record brain responses to tactile stimuli in patients with idiopathic PD and healthy controls before and after three-week rhythmic auditory stimulation-assisted gait (RASg) training. Consistent with the presence of striatal degeneration, patients showed right posterior putamen (pPut) hypoactivation when detecting tactile stimuli of their left leg. They also exhibited reduced functional connectivity from the right pPut to the right parietal somatosensory region (inferior parietal lobule, IPL), whose hypoactivation reflected patients' impaired tactile detectability. Importantly, this dysconnectivity predicted right IPL hypoactivation, indicating that pPut-IPL dysconnectivity underlay patients' impaired tactile detectability. Intriguingly, RASg training normalized patients' tactile detectability, which was mirrored by normalization of right IPL activation and pPut-IPL connectivity. Training-induced changes in pPut-IPL connectivity predicted changes in IPL activation during tactile detection, reinforcing the role of pPut-IPL connectivity in patients' tactile detectability. These findings suggest that somatosensory abnormalities in PD may arise from the spread of striatal pathology to relevant cortical regions. Rhythmic auditory-motor training acts to recover striatal connectivity, improving PD patients' somatosensory deficits.",1
39718440,Ultrasensitive Protein Aggregate Quantification Assays for Neurodegenerative Diseases on the Simoa Platform.,"Nanoscale aggregates play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, quantifying these aggregates in complex biological samples, such as biofluids and postmortem brain tissue, has been challenging due to their low concentration and small size, necessitating the development of methods with high sensitivity and specificity. Here, we have developed ultrasensitive assays utilizing the Quanterix Simoa platform to detect α-synuclein, β-amyloid and tau aggregates, including those with common posttranslational modifications such as truncation of α-synuclein and AT8 phosphorylation of tau aggregates. All assays had a detection limit in the low pM range. As a part of this work, we developed silica-nanoparticle calibrators, allowing for the quantification of all aggregates. These assays were validated for aggregate and target specificity through denaturation and cross-reactivity experiments. We then applied these assays to brain homogenate samples from Alzheimer's disease and control samples, demonstrating their applicability to postmortem tissue. Lastly, we explored the potential of these assays for blood-based diagnostics by detecting aggregates in serum samples from early Alzheimer's disease patients.",1
39717687,Machine learning based algorithms for virtual early detection and screening of neurodegenerative and neurocognitive disorders: a systematic-review.,"Neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) lead to neuronal loss; neurocognitive disorders (e.g., delirium, dementia) show cognitive decline. Early detection is crucial for effective management. Machine learning aids in more precise disease identification, potentially transforming healthcare. This comprehensive systematic review discusses how machine learning (ML), can enhance early detection of these disorders, surpassing traditional diagnostics' constraints. In this review, databases were examined up to August 15th, 2023, for ML data on neurodegenerative and neurocognitive diseases using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Two investigators used the RAYYAN intelligence tool for systematic reviews to conduct the screening. Six blinded reviewers reviewed titles/abstracts. Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment. Our search found 7,069 research studies, of which 1,365 items were duplicates and thus removed. Four thousand three hundred and thirty four studies were screened, and 108 articles met the criteria for inclusion after preprocessing. Twelve ML algorithms were observed for dementia, showing promise in early detection. Eighteen ML algorithms were identified for Parkinson's, each effective in detection and diagnosis. Studies emphasized that ML algorithms are necessary for Alzheimer's to be successful. Fourteen ML algorithms were discovered for mild cognitive impairment, with LASSO logistic regression being the only one with unpromising results. This review emphasizes the pressing necessity of integrating verified digital health resources into conventional medical practice. This integration may signify a new era in the early detection of neurodegenerative and neurocognitive illnesses, potentially changing the course of these conditions for millions globally. This study showcases specific and statistically significant findings to illustrate the progress in the area and the prospective influence of these advancements on the global management of neurocognitive and neurodegenerative illnesses.",1

Reduced ALPS index has been suggested to indicate impaired glymphatic function. However, the potential impact of crossing fibres on the ALPS index has not been assessed, which was the aim of this cross-sectional study.

39703622,A survey of detection of Parkinson's disease using artificial intelligence models with multiple modalities and various data preprocessing techniques.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that causes symptoms such as tremors, sleeplessness, behavioral problems, sensory abnormalities, and impaired mobility, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have been used in recent studies (2015-2023) to improve PD diagnosis by categorizing patients and healthy controls based on similar clinical presentations. This study investigates several datasets, modalities, and data preprocessing techniques from the collected data. Issues are also addressed, with suggestions for future PD research involving subgrouping and connection analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data. We have used different models like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for detecting PD at an early stage. We have used the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset 3D brain images and archived the 86.67%, 94.02%, accuracy of models, respectively.",1
39702611,Multimodal oculomotor assessment reveals prodromal markers of Parkinson's disease in non-manifesting LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers.,"Oculomotor behaviour changes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are a promising source of prodromal disease markers. Capitalizing on this phenomenon to facilitate early diagnosis requires oculomotor assessment in prodromal cohorts. We examined oculomotor behaviour in non-manifesting LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers (LRRK2-NM), who have heightened PD risk.Seventeen LRRK2-NM participants, 47 patients with idiopathic PD, and 63 healthy age-matched control participants completed an interleaved pro- and antisaccade task while undergoing video-based eye-tracking. We analyzed between-group differences in saccade, pupil, blink, and fixation acquisition behaviour. Patients with PD showed previously demonstrated abnormalities (saccade hypometria, antisaccade errors). Relative to controls, LRRK2-NM participants and patients with PD both displayed increased short-latency prosaccades and reduced pupil velocity, plus altered fixation acquisition-less preemptive returning of gaze to the future fixation point location. Interestingly, the effect on blink probability was opposite-higher than controls in LRRK2-NM participants but lower in patients with PD. Future longitudinal studies must confirm the viability of these features as prodromal PD markers.",1
39699073,The Utility of Long-Read Sequencing in Diagnosing Early Onset Parkinson's Disease.,"Variants in PRKN and PINK1 are the leading cause of early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, yet many cases remain genetically unresolved. We previously identified a 7 megabases complex structural variant in a pair of monozygotic twins using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. This study aims to determine if ONT long-read sequencing can detect a second variant in other unresolved early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with 1 heterozygous PRKN or PINK1 variant. ONT long-read sequencing was performed on EOPD patients with 1 reported PRKN/PINK1 pathogenic variant, with onset age under 50. Positive controls included EOPD patients with 2 known PRKN pathogenic variants. Initial testing involved short-read targeted panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants. A total of 47 patients were studied (PRKN ""one-variant,"" n = 23; PINK1 ""one-variant,"" n = 12; PRKN ""two-variants,"" n = 12). ONT long-read sequencing identified a second pathogenic variant in 26% of PRKN ""one-variant"" patients (6/23), but none in PINK1 ""one-variant"" patients (0/12). Detected variants included 1 complex inversion, 2 structural variant overlaps, and 3 duplications. In the PRKN ""two-variants"" group, both variants were identified in all patients (100%, 12/12). ONT long-read sequencing effectively identifies pathogenic structural variants in the PRKN locus missed by conventional methods. It should be considered for unresolved EOPD cases when a second variant is not detected through conventional approaches. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:753-765.",1
39697483,Magnetic resonance imaging of brain structural and functional changes in cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease.,"Cognitive impairment is a critical non-motor symptom of Parkinson's Disease (PD) that profoundly affects patients' quality of life. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating the structural and functional brain changes associated with cognitive impairment in PD (PD-CI). MRI techniques enable the precise identification and monitoring of the onset and progression of cognitive deficits in PD. This review synthesizes recent literature on the use of MRI-based techniques, including voxel-based morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI, in the study of PD-CI. By examining these imaging modalities, the article aims to elucidate the patterns of brain structural and functional alterations in PD-CI, offering critical insights that can inform clinical management and therapeutic strategies. In particular, this review provides a novel synthesis of recent advancements in understanding how specific MRI metrics, such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity, contribute to early detection and personalized treatment approaches for PD-CI. The integration of findings from these studies enhances our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in PD and highlights the potential of MRI as a supportive tool in the clinical assessment and treatment of PD-CI.",1
39684900,Emerging Biomarkers in Metabolomics: Advancements in Precision Health and Disease Diagnosis.,"Metabolomics has come to the fore as an efficient tool in the search for biomarkers that are critical for precision health approaches and improved diagnostics. This review will outline recent advances in biomarker discovery based on metabolomics, focusing on metabolomics biomarkers reported in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic health. In cancer, metabolomics provides evidence for unique oncometabolites that are important for early disease detection and monitoring of treatment responses. Metabolite profiling for conditions such as neurodegenerative and mental health disorders can offer early diagnosis and mechanisms into the disease especially in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In addition to these, lipid biomarkers and other metabolites relating to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders are promising for patient stratification and personalized treatment. The gut microbiome and environmental exposure also feature among the influential factors in biomarker discovery because they sculpt individual metabolic profiles, impacting overall health. Further, we discuss technological advances in metabolomics, current clinical applications, and the challenges faced by metabolomics biomarker validation toward precision medicine. Finally, this review discusses future opportunities regarding the integration of metabolomics into routine healthcare to enable preventive and personalized approaches.",1
39684324,"Decoding Neurodegeneration: A Review of Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Advances in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS.","Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, and Huntington's, remain formidable challenges in medicine, with their relentless progression and limited therapeutic options. These diseases arise from a web of molecular disturbances-misfolded proteins, chronic neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genetic mutations-that slowly dismantle neuronal integrity. Yet, recent scientific breakthroughs are opening new paths to intervene in these once-intractable conditions. This review synthesizes the latest insights into the underlying molecular dynamics of neurodegeneration, revealing how intertwined pathways drive the course of these diseases. With an eye on the most promising advances, we explore innovative therapies emerging from cutting-edge research: nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems capable of navigating the blood-brain barrier, gene-editing tools like CRISPR designed to correct harmful genetic variants, and stem cell strategies that not only replace lost neurons but foster neuroprotective environments. Pharmacogenomics is reshaping treatment personalization, enabling tailored therapies that align with individual genetic profiles, while molecular diagnostics and biomarkers are ushering in an era of early, precise disease detection. Furthermore, novel perspectives on the gut-brain axis are sparking interest as mounting evidence suggests that microbiome modulation may play a role in reducing neuroinflammatory responses linked to neurodegenerative progression. Taken together, these advances signal a shift toward a comprehensive, personalized approach that could transform neurodegenerative care. By integrating molecular insights and innovative therapeutic techniques, this review offers a forward-looking perspective on a future where treatments aim not just to manage symptoms but to fundamentally alter disease progression, presenting renewed hope for improved patient outcomes.",1
39682524,Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease Using AI Techniques and Image Analysis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis benefits significantly from advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and image processing techniques. This paper explores various approaches for processing hand-drawn Archimedean spirals in order to detect signs of PD. The best approach is selected to be integrated in a neurodegenerative disease management platform called NeuroPredict. The most innovative aspects of the presented approaches are related to the employed feature extraction techniques that convert hand-drawn spirals into a frequency spectra, so that frequency features may be extracted and utilized as inputs for various classification algorithms. A second category of extracted features contains information related to the thickness and pressure of drawings. The selected approach achieves an overall accuracy of 95.24% and allows acquiring new test data using only a pencil and paper, without requiring a specialized device like a graphic tablet or a digital pen. This study underscores the clinical relevance of AI in enhancing diagnostic precision for neurodegenerative diseases.",1
39680179,Serum neurofilament light chain as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in multiple system atrophy: a prospective cohort study.,"Neurofilament light chain (NFL) in blood has been identified as a valuable biomarker in multiple system atrophy (MSA), but data regarding its utility in the early diagnosis and prognosis of MSA remain limited. To investigate serum NFL's diagnostic and prognostic value in patients with MSA in a prospective clinical cohort. Two hundred twenty-eight participants were enrolled, including ninety-eight with MSA, seventeen with uncertain MSA at inclusion, fifty-nine with Parkinson's disease (PD), and fifty-four healthy controls (HCs). Patients with MSA and uncertain diagnoses were followed up. Serum NFL levels were measured with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay at baseline. Patients with MSA and uncertain diagnoses underwent repeated clinical assessments with a median follow-up period of 1.43 years. The final diagnoses included 102 MSA, 62 PD, and 54 HCs. Serum NFL levels were significantly higher in MSA and PD than in HCs. Serum NFL levels, with cutoff values of 223.5 and 218.0 pg/mL, could discriminate between patients with MSA and PD (AUC = 0.930) in the early disease stages, and between MSA-parkinsonism subtypes and PD (AUC = 0.878). Higher serum NFL levels were independently associated with a shorter median time to poor prognosis and death. In addition, reduced levodopa responsiveness was correlated with poor outcomes, and orthostatic hypotension (OH) was linked to a higher risk of death. Serum NFL levels can not only differentiate between MSA, MSA-P, and PD in the early stages of the disease but also serve as a reliable independent predictor of poor prognosis and survival time in MSA.",1
39678127,Strategies of positron emission tomography (PET) tracer development for imaging of tau and α-synuclein in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques consisting of β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) protein in the brain. Genetic and animal studies strongly indicate that Aβ, tau and neuroinflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Several staging models showed that NFTs correlated well with the disease progression. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become a widely used non-invasive technique to image NFTs for early diagnosis of AD. Despite the remarkable progress made over the past few years, tau PET imaging is still challenging due to the nature of tau pathology and the technical aspects of PET imaging. Tau pathology often coexists with other proteinopathies, such as Aβ plaques and α-synuclein aggregates. Distinguishing tau-specific signals from other overlapping pathologies is difficult, especially in the context of AD, where multiple protein aggregates are present, as well as the spectrum of different tau isoforms (3R and 4R) and conformations. Moreover, tracers should ideally have optimal pharmacokinetic properties to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) while maintaining specificity, low toxicity, low non-specific binding, rapid uptake and clearance from the brain, and formation of no radiolabeled metabolites in the brain. On the other hand, Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulations of α-synuclein in neurons. Heterogeneity and the unclear pathogenesis of PD hinder early and accurate diagnosis of the disease for therapeutic development in clinical use. In this review, while referring to existing reviews, we focus on the design strategies and current progress in tau (NFTs) targeting new PET tracers for AD; evolution of non-AD tau targeting PET tracers for applications including progressive supranuclear paralysis (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD); new PET tracer development for α-synuclein aggregate imaging in PD and giving an outlook for future PET tracer development.",1
39677584,The relationship between anticholinergic burden and frailty in the year preceding a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Little is known regarding the relationship between anticholinergic medications and frailty in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale (ACB) and Claims-based Frailty Index scores were calculated for 12 months prior to the dementia diagnosis using electronic medical record and claims data. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between ACB and odds of frailty. Compared to controls ( Cumulative anticholinergic burden may be a modifiable predictor of frailty among older adults, including those newly diagnosed with dementia. Patients with newly diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are more likely to have prescriptions for anticholinergic medications relative to patients newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and older adults without documented cognitive impairment.In the year prior to a documented dementia diagnosis, 74% of patients with DLB and 66% of patients with AD had evidence of frailty.Anticholinergic medication burden was associated with frailty among all older adults in the study, including those without a dementia diagnosis.",1
39677454,Genetic Diversity and Expanded Phenotypes in Dystonia: Insights from Large-Scale Exome Sequencing.,"Dystonia is one of the most prevalent movement disorders, characterized by significant clinical and etiological heterogeneity. Despite considerable heritability (~25%) and the identification of several disease-linked genes, the etiology in most patients remains elusive. Moreover, understanding the correlations between clinical manifestation and genetic variants has become increasingly complex. To comprehensively unravel dystonia's genetic spectrum, we performed exome sequencing on 1,924 dystonia patients [40.3% male, 92.9% White, 93.2% isolated dystonia, median age at onset (AAO) 33 years], including 1,895 index patients, who were previously genetically unsolved. The sample was mainly based on two dystonia registries (DysTract and the Dystonia Coalition). Further, 72 additional patients of Asian ethnicity, mainly from Malaysia, were also included. We prioritized patients with negative genetic prescreening, early AAO, positive family history, and multisite involvement of dystonia. Rare variants in genes previously linked to dystonia (",1
39676433,ROS Regulation in CNS Disorder Therapy: Unveiling the Dual Roles of Nanomedicine.,"The treatment of brain diseases has always been the focus of attention. Due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), most small molecule drugs are difficult to reach the brain, leading to undesirable therapeutic outcomes. Recently, nanomedicines that can cross the BBB and precisely target lesion sites have emerged as thrilling tools to enhance the early diagnosis and treat various intractable brain disorders. Extensive research has shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of brain diseases, including brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, or traumatic brain injury, making ROS a potential therapeutic target. In this review, on the structure and function of BBB as well as the mechanisms are first elaborated through which nanomedicine traverses it. Then, recent studies on ROS production are summarized through photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for treating brain tumors, and ROS depletion for treating NDDs. This provides valuable guidance for the future design of ROS-targeted nanomedicines for brain disease treatment. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in developing nanomedicine-based ROS management for brain diseases are also discussed and outlined.",1
39676193,Nonmotor Manifestations of Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease and Its Correlation with the Severity and Duration of the Disease: A Cross-sectional Study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is common in individuals over the age of 50 years, affecting about 1% of the population. Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are a common occurrence in PD, but they are often ignored by motor symptoms. Studies have shown that NMS in PD show a significant impact on quality of life. The introduction of tools like nonmotor symptoms scale (NMSS) and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) that have a specific nonmotor domain will assist in defining research and therapy to enhance the early identification and management of NMS in the affected population. (1) To evaluate the prevalence of NMS in different stages of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. (2) To correlate the prevalence of NMS with the duration and severity of the disease. The study involved 80 individuals who visited the Movement Disorder Clinic at Stanley Medical College and Hospital in Chennai and were diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, which was in agreement with the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease (UK PD) Brain Bank criteria. Out of the 80 study participants, 63.7% ( NMSs are found to be highly prevalent among Indian patients with PD according to this study. The nonmotor symptom questionnaire aids in early detection and recognition of nonmotor symptoms in PD patients.",1
39667505,Exploring and validating key genetic biomarkers for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition characterized by complex genetic basic, and the reliable diagnosis of PD remained limited. To identify genes crucial to PD and assess their potential as diagnostic markers. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from the PD tissue dataset and blood dataset. Two machine learning methods were used to identify key PD-related genes. The genes were validated in an independent dataset. Further validation using 120 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PD patients. The clinical significance and the diagnostic value of the genes was determined. The function of genes was analyzed and verified by cells experiments. Thirteen common upregulated genes were identified between PD tissue dataset and blood dataset. Two machine learning methods identify three key PD-related genes (GPX2, CR1, ZNF556). An independent dataset and PBMCs samples results showed increased expression in PD patients. Clinical analysis showed that GPX2 and CR1 expression correlated with early-stage PD. The validated dataset of blood samples revealed each three gene showed moderate diagnostic potential for PD, with combined analysis outperforming individual gene analysis (AUC:0.701). The PBMCs samples showed similar diagnostic value of each gene, and the combination of the three genes presented better diagnostic value (AUC:0.801). Functional studies highlighted the involvement of these genes in key pathways in PD pathology. The results of SH-SY5Y cells showed that these three genes increased from PD cell model. GPX2, CR1, ZNF556 were critical to the development of PD and might serve as diagnostic markers for PD.",1
39667295,Brain health: Pathway to primary prevention of neurodegenerative disorders of environmental origin.,"While rising global rates of neurodegenerative disease encourage early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention to block clinical expression (secondary prevention), a more powerful approach is to identify and remove environmental factors that trigger long-latencybrain disease (primary prevention) by acting on a susceptible genotype or acting alone. The latter is illustrated by the post-World War II decline and disappearance of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinsonism-Dementia Complex (ALS/PDC), a prototypical often-familial neurodegenerative disease formerly present in very high incidence on the island of Guam. Lessons learned from 75 years of investigation on the etiology of ALS/PDC include: the importance of focusing field research on the disease epicenter and patients with early-onset disease; soliciting exposure history from patients, family, and community to guide multidisciplinary biomedical investigation; recognition that disease phenotype may vary with exposure history, and that familial brain disease may have a primarily environmental origin. Furthermore, removal from exposure to the environmental trigger effects primary disease prevention.",1
39666067,Myelin basic protein and TREM2 quantification in the CSF of patients with Multiple System Atrophy and other Parkinsonian conditions.,"It is well known that myelin disruption and neuroinflammation are early and distinct pathological hallmarks in multiple system atrophy (MSA) as well as in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and in other atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. The objective of this study was to assess the value of non-neuronal biomarker candidates that reflect myelin disruption and neuroinflammation. Myelin basic protein (MBP) and the soluble form of TREM2 were quantified in a comprehensive movement disorder cohort from two different neurological centers, comprising a total of 171 CSF samples. Commercially available ELISA systems were employed for quantification. The results of the MBP analysis revealed a significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) MBP levels in all atypical Parkinsonian conditions compared to PD. This differentiation was more pronounced in the MSA-c subtype compared to MSA-p. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed a significant discrimination between PD and MSA (p = 0.032, AUC = 0.70), PD and DLB (p = 0.006, AUC = 0.79) and PD and tauopathies (p = 0.006, AUC = 0.74). The results of the TREM2 analysis demonstrated no significant differences between the PD and atypical Parkinsonian groups if not adjusted for confounders. After adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration, the PD group exhibited significantly higher TREM2 levels compared to the DLB group (p = 0.002). In conclusion, MBP, but not TREM2, is elevated in the CSF of not only MSA but in all atypical Parkinsonian conditions compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. This highlights the value of the evaluation of myelin/oligodendrocyte-associated markers in neurodegenerative movement disorders.",1
39666053,How to distinguish spinocerebellar ataxia 27B from late onset cerebellar ataxia: insights from a case-control study.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B is the most common genetic late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA). However, it commonly overlaps with other genetic LOCA as with the cerebellar form of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C). To pinpoint which clinical signs and symptoms best discriminate between FGF14 + from FGF14 - patients at symptoms' onset. Twenty SCA27B (≥ 250 GAA repeat expansion) patients were retrospectively matched by gender and age at disease onset with 20 negative FGF14 (-) LOCA patients and with 20 MSA-C patients. Clinical features were ranked based on their contribution towards distinguishing between the groups (feature importance ranking). SCA27B patients had significantly higher rates of episodic symptoms, cerebellar oculomotor signs, dysdiadochokinesia, and alcohol intolerance than LOCA-FGF14 - ataxia patients. The lack of autonomic symptoms and MRI signs in SCA27B patients were the most discriminating features from MSA-C. An AUC of 0.87 was obtained if using the ""top 3 clinical features model"" (episodic symptoms, cerebellar oculomotor signs and dysdiadochokinesia) to distinguish SCAB27 from LCOA FGF14 - . Regarding MRI findings, no significant differences were found between SCA27B and FGF14 - patients, while a positive hot cross buns sign and the presence of brainstem atrophy were key distinguishing features between SCA27B from MSA-C patients (p < 0.005). Our pilot case-control study contributes to the identification of early clinical symptoms to differentiate SCA27B to LOCA patients including FGF14- and MSA-C ones. From a feature perspective, while clinical features are crucial, identifying surrogate biomarkers-such as ocular or gait parameters-could aid in the early diagnosis and follow-up of SCA27B patients.",1
39665795,Plasma circulating cell-free DNA integrity and relative telomere length as diagnostic biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy: a cross-sectional study.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202512000-00025/figure1/v/2025-01-31T122243Z/r/image-tiff In clinical specialties focusing on neurological disorders, there is a need for comprehensive and integrated non-invasive, sensitive, and specific testing methods. Both Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are classified as α-synucleinopathies, characterized by abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein protein, which provides a shared pathological background for their comparative study. In addition, both Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy involve neuronal death, a process that may release circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the bloodstream, leading to specific alterations. This premise formed the basis for investigating cell-free DNA as a potential biomarker. Cell-free DNA has garnered attention for its potential pathological significance, yet its characteristics in the context of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy are not fully understood. This study investigated the total concentration, nonapoptotic level, integrity, and cell-free DNA relative telomere length of cell-free DNA in the peripheral blood of 171 participants, comprising 76 normal controls, 62 patients with Parkinson's disease, and 33 patients with multiple system atrophy. In our cohort, 75.8% of patients with Parkinson's disease (stage 1-2 of Hoehn & Yahr) and 60.6% of patients with multiple system atrophy (disease duration less than 3 years) were in the early stages. The diagnostic potential of the cell-free DNA parameters was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and their association with disease prevalence was examined through logistic regression models, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, and education level. The results showed that cell-free DNA integrity was significantly elevated in both Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy patients compared with normal controls ( P < 0.001 for both groups), whereas cell-free DNA relative telomere length was markedly shorter ( P = 0.003 for Parkinson's disease and P = 0.010 for multiple system atrophy). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that both cell-free DNA integrity and cell-free DNA relative telomere length possessed good diagnostic accuracy for differentiating Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy from normal controls. Specifically, higher cell-free DNA integrity was associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease (odds ratio [OR]: 5.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-24.19) and multiple system atrophy (OR: 10.10; 95% CI: 1.55-122.98). Conversely, longer cell-free DNA relative telomere length was linked to reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04-0.54) and multiple system atrophy (OR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01-0.57). These findings suggest that cell-free DNA integrity and cell-free DNA relative telomere length may serve as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, potentially reflecting specific underlying pathophysiological processes of these neurodegenerative disorders.",1

In conclusion despite HSI has been presented as a significant advanced medical imaging tool, addressing its limitations and probable solutions is for broader clinical adoption.",1
39654952,Exploring the layers of fatigue in Parkinson's Disease: A comprehensive analysis of its prevalence and contributing factors.,"Fatigue is a prevalent yet under-recognized non-motor symptom (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Despite its clinical importance, the relationship between fatigue and other motor and non-motor symptoms remains poorly understood. Its frequent co-occurrence with other NMS further complicates both diagnosis and management, often leading to underdiagnosis and suboptimal treatment. This gap in understanding is largely due to the limited exploration of fatigue in PD. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of fatigue at baseline and up to 10 years after symptom onset in a large, well-characterized PD cohort (PPMI) and to explore its associations with other non-motor symptoms (NMS). By providing insights into the prevalence and correlations of fatigue, our goal is to highlight the need for early identification and management, guiding future research efforts.  We conducted a retrospective study using the PPMI database. Fatigue was assessed using item 1.13 of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Logistic regression was used to analyze the impact of different variables on fatigue, while point-biserial correlation analysis gauged the relationship between continuous variables and fatigue. At baseline study visit, 52% (575) of patients reported experiencing fatigue, with 9% reporting moderate to severe fatigue early in the disease course. Higher scores on several scales were significantly associated with an increased risk of fatigue, though most associations were weak. Significant associations included the REM Sleep Behavioral Disorder Questionnaire (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.11), Geriatric Depression Scale (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02), SCOPA-Autonomic Dysfunction (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03-1.06), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04-1.08), and Apathy (OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 2.4-3.5). Over half of patients reported fatigue at baseline, underscoring its significant prevalence early in PD. The predominantly weak associations with other NMS highlight the necessity for comprehensive patient screening and targeted interventions, as addressing one NMS may not effectively alleviate others.",1
39654757,Epigenomic and clinical analyses of striatal DAT binding in healthy individuals reveal well-known loci of Parkinson's disease.,"Striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding is a sensitive and specific endophenotype for detecting dopaminergic deficits across Parkinson's disease (PD) spectrum. Molecular and clinical signatures of PD in asymptomatic phases help understand the earliest pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. We aimed to investigate whether blood epigenetic markers are associated with inter-individual variation of striatal DAT binding among healthy elderly individuals. We also investigated whether this potential inter-individual variation can manifest as dysfunction of particular cognitive domains. Omics studies conducted on endophenotypes of PD among healthy asymptomatic individuals can provide invaluable insights into early detection, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets for PD. We conducted a blood epigenome-wide association study of striatal DAT binding on 96 healthy individuals using the Illumina EPIC array. For functional annotation of our top results, we employed the enhancer-gene mapping strategy using a midbrain single-nucleus multimodal dataset. Finally, we conducted several investigative regression analyses on several neuropsychological tests across five cognitive domains to assess their association with striatal DAT binding among 250 healthy subjects. We identified seven suggestive (P-value<10 Our study suggested epigenetic and cognitive signatures of striatal DAT binding among healthy individuals, providing valuable insights for future experimental and clinical studies of early PD.",1
39652919,The Prevalence and Clinical Significance of Skin Manifestations in Parkinson's Disease Patients.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterized by motor symptoms, but non-motor symptoms, including skin manifestations, are increasingly recognized. These remain underexplored despite their potential impact on quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and clinical features of skin findings in PD patients, with a focus on identifying potential pathogenetic links between dermatological conditions and PD. A total of 215 PD patients were included. Comprehensive dermatological examinations were performed, and demographic and clinical data were collected. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 23.0, with significance set at P < 0.05. Skin conditions were found in 92.1% of PD patients. Xerosis, seborrheic dermatitis, and hyperhidrosis were the most common findings. Pre-PD xerosis was associated with an earlier stage of PD (P = 0.001). Use of PD medications, such as levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone, was linked to a lower incidence of seborrheic dermatitis (P = 0.040). A significant correlation was also noted between rosacea and cherry angioma (P = 0.01). Dermatological conditions are prevalent in PD and may precede its motor symptoms. Skin assessments could aid early diagnosis and management of PD, highlighting the need for further research on their pathogenetic mechanisms.",1
39652643,Transmission of peripheral blood α-synuclein fibrils exacerbates synucleinopathy and neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease by endothelial Lag3 endocytosis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder. The pathological feature of PD is abnormal α-synuclein (α-syn) formation and transmission. Recent evidence demonstrates that α-syn preformed fibrils (α-syn PFFs) can be detected in the serum of patients with PD. The peripheral blood α-syn PFF can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and aggravate neuronal damage, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. We constructed the PD mouse models of different severity: the mild pathology (A53T ONLY) and the severe pathology (A53T + Brain FIB); this was followed by α-syn PFFs intravenous injection. Then, we used endothelium-specific Lag3 knockout mice (Lag3-ECs-CKO) to decrease the blood α-syn PFFs spreading. We observed that intravenous transmission of α-syn PFFs significantly aggravated motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, neuroinflammation, and pathologic α-syn deposition in A53T ONLY, but not in A53T + Brain FIB. Blocking endothelial Lag3 endocytosis by Lag3-ECs-CKO decreased the blood α-syn PFFs spreading and improved the symptoms and pathogenesis of PD mice. Our findings reveal the role of peripheral blood α-syn PFFs transmission in the mild pathology or early-stage PD and the mechanism of endothelial Lag3 endocytosis in the pathology of α-syn transmission. Targeting endothelial Lag3 to prevent α-syn from spreading from the blood to the brain may be a disease-modifying therapy in early-stage PD.",1
39649721,Total burden of cerebral small vessel disease predict subjective cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"This study investigates the correlation between the total burden of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD) and Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A cross-sectional design was employed, involving 422 patients with PD. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted to identify CSVD markers. SCD was assessed using the Cognitive Complaints Inventory (CCI). Logistic regression analyses revealed that the total burden of CSVD and specific imaging markers, including Deep White Matter Hyperintensities (DWMH), Periventricular Hyperintensities (PVH), and Enlarged Perivascular Spaces (EPVS), were significant predictors of SCD. The total burden of CSVD demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for SCD in PD patients. The findings suggest that the total burden of CSVD, as measured by MRI, could serve as a potential biomarker for early identification of cognitive decline in PD, highlighting the importance of considering vascular factors in the early detection of cognitive changes in PD.",1
39648869,The Amplification of Alpha-Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils is Suppressed under Fully Quiescent Conditions.,"Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, when amplifying fibrils from patient-derived samples in multiwell plates, it is currently highly challenging to accurately quantify the aggregates. It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate-based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. Therefore, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets. We further show that the amplification inside droplets can be achieved by subjecting the microemulsions to high-frequency vibrations using a piezo device. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the physical requirements of alpha-synuclein seed amplification and demonstrate a pathway towards the development of effective digital SAAs.",1
39639040,Bidirectional relationship between olfaction and Parkinson's disease.,"Hyposmia (decreased smell function) is a common early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). The shared genetic architecture between hyposmia and PD is unknown. We leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) results for self-assessment of 'ability to smell' and PD diagnosis to determine shared genetic architecture between the two traits. Linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression found that the sense of smell negatively correlated at a genome-wide level with PD. Local Analysis of [co]Variant Association (LAVA) found negative correlations in four genetic loci near GBA1, ANAPC4, SNCA, and MAPT, indicating shared genetic liability only within a subset of prominent PD risk genes. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence for a strong causal relationship between PD and liability towards poorer sense of smell, but weaker evidence for the reverse direction. This work highlights the heritability of olfactory function and its relationship with PD heritability and provides further insight into the association between PD and hyposmia.",1
39636352,Examination of the autonomic nervous system at the bedside.,"Autonomic function is an integral part of the assessment of neurological disorders. However, pragmatically, it is often the most neglected part of neurological examination and is often limited to testing for orthostatic hypotension. Testing the autonomic nervous system may aid in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, thereby enabling the initiation of neuroprotective strategies and resulting in improved quality of life in this group of patients. It may also enable differentiation between certain atypical parkinsonisms, such as Multiple System Atrophy and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, in which autonomic dysfunction is early and usually profound compared to Parkinson's disease. Our review focusses on the ""first-line"" autonomic function tests which can be done at the bedside and require use of minimal equipment and provide insights into cardiovascular, pupillary and sudomotor function. The use of minimal equipment underscores the value of these tests in resource-constrained settings as a major unmet need, thereby saving resources and avoiding delays in diagnosis and treatment.",1
39635017,Observational and genetic associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and age-related diseases: longitudinal analyses in the UK Biobank study.,"Observational studies have indicated that increased cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the causal mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the role of fitness in the early detection and reduction of disease risk within the framework of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM). The associations of fitness with CVD, AD, and PD were explored in a large cohort of up to 502,486 individuals between the ages of 40 and 69 years from the UK Biobank. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of CVD, AD, and PD among participants who completed a submaximal fitness test. Causality relationships were assessed via two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). After a median of 11 years of follow-up, each 3.5 ml of O Our results indicate that fitness has an effect on age-related diseases. Protective associations of higher fitness levels with the risk of CVD, AD, and PD were validated in this cohort study. These findings might be valuable for predicting, preventing, and reducing disease morbidity and mortality through primary prevention and healthcare in the context of PPPM.

39634776,Quality of life in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy: a review of literature and implications for practice.,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an atypical form of parkinsonism characterized by tauopathy, manifesting as oculomotor dysfunction, postural instability, akinesia, and cognitive/language impairments. The diagnosis and examination of PSP can be challenging, primarily due to the unclear and underexplored pathomechanisms involved, alongside absence of effective treatments. Clinical variants of PSP is the second most common form of neurodegenerative parkinsonism after Parkinson's disease (PD). It is defined by a symmetrical akinetic-rigid syndrome (atypical parkinsonism) and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. In contrast to PD, PSP often presents with gait instability, backward falls, and cognitive and behavioral changes at early disease stages. The classification of PSP has evolved since Richardson, Steele, and Olszewski's initial reporting of the condition in 1963, which included a cohort of nine patients. Over the years, the definition of this disorder has evolved to encapsulate a group of patients with distinct clinical variants, notably the classical Richardson syndrome (RS) and several atypical phenotypes, each with significant implications for disease progression and quality of life (QoL). The 2017 Movement Disorder Society Diagnostic Criteria by Hoglinger et al., improved the sensitivity for detecting early and variant PSP presentations and provided more specific differential diagnoses for conditions such as PD and other forms of atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Owing to the growing interest in the disease's progression, evaluating the QoL for patients with PSP has become crucial. This review emphasizes the significance of QoL evaluation and its feasibility for practical implications, serving as an initial foundation for future research focused on the well-being of individuals affected by PSP. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an atypical form of parkinsonism characterized by tauopathy, manifesting as oculomotor dysfunction, postural instability, akinesia, and cognitive/language impairments. Diagnosing PSP is challenging owing to the lack of tools for differential examination. Additionally, the pathomechanism of this disease is not sufficiently understood, and no treatment is currently available. Owing to the growing interest in the disease's progression, evaluating the quality of life (QoL) for patients with PSP has become crucial. This review emphasizes the significance of QoL evaluation and its feasibility for practical implications, serving as an initial foundation for future research focused on the well-being of individuals affected by PSP.",1
39632912,Slovak database of speech affected by neurodegenerative diseases.,"A new Slovak speech database EWA-DB was created for research purposes aimed at early detection of neurodegenerative diseases from speech. It contains 1649 speakers performing various speech and language tasks, such as sustained vowel phonation, diadochokinesis, naming and picture description. The sample of speakers consists of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, and healthy controls. In this article we describe the EWA-DB development process, the language and speech task selection, patient and healthy control recruitment, as well as the testing and recording protocol. The structure and content of the database and file formats are described in detail. We assume that the presented database could be suitable for the development of automatic systems predicting the diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and Parkinson's disease from language and speech features.",1
39630936,Nerve-Inspired Optical Waveguide Stretchable Sensor Fusing Wireless Transmission and AI Enabling Smart Tele-Healthcare.,"Flexible strain monitoring of hand and joint muscle movement is recognized as an effective method for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neurological diseases such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. However, balancing high sensitivity and large strain, improving wearing comfort, and solving the separation of diagnosis and treatment are important challenges for further building tele-healthcare systems. Herein, a hydrogel-based optical waveguide stretchable (HOWS) sensor is proposed in this paper. A double network structure is adopted to allow the HOWS sensor to exhibit high stretchability of the tensile strain up to 600% and sensitivity of 0.685 mV %",1
39627487,Transformer-based transfer learning on self-reported voice recordings for Parkinson's disease diagnosis.,"Deep learning (DL) techniques are becoming more popular for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) because they offer non-invasive and easily accessible tools. By using advanced data analysis, these methods improve early detection and diagnosis, which is crucial for managing the disease effectively. This study explores end-to-end DL architectures, such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, for diagnosing PD using self-reported voice data collected via smartphones in everyday settings. Transfer learning was applied by starting with models pre-trained on large datasets from the image and the audio domains and then fine-tuning them on the mPower voice data. The Transformer model pre-trained on the voice data performed the best, achieving an average AUC of [Formula: see text] and an average AUPRC of [Formula: see text], outperforming models trained from scratch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a Transformer model for audio data in PD diagnosis, using this dataset. We achieved better results than previous studies, whether they focused solely on the voice or incorporated multiple modalities, by relying only on the voice as a biomarker. These results show that using self-reported voice data with state-of-the-art DL architectures can significantly improve PD prediction and diagnosis, potentially leading to better patient outcomes.",1
39627312,An innovative cellular medicine approach via the utilization of novel nanotechnology-based biomechatronic platforms as a label-free biomarker for early melanoma diagnosis.,"Innovative cellular medicine (ICM) is an exponentially emerging field with a promising approach to combating complex and ubiquitous life-threatening diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), arthritis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and cancer. Together with the advancement of nanotechnology and bio-mechatronics, ICM revolutionizes cellular therapy in understanding the essence and nature of the disease initiated at a single-cell level. This paper focuses on the intricate nature of cancer that requires multi-disciplinary efforts to characterize it well in order to achieve the objectives of modern world contemporary medicine in the early detection of the disease at a cellular level and potentially arrest its proliferation mechanism. This justifies the multidisciplinary research backgrounds of the authors of this paper in advancing cellular medicine by bridging the gap between experimental biology and the engineering field. Thus, in pursuing this approach, two novel miniaturized and highly versatile biomechatronic platforms with dedicated operating software and microelectronics are designed, modeled, nanofabricated, and tested in numerous in vitro experiments to investigate a hypothesis and arrive at a proven theorem in carcinogenesis by interrelating cellular contractile force, membrane potential, and cellular morphology for early detection and characterization of melanoma cancer cells. The novelties that flourished within this work are manifested in sixfold: (1) developing a mathematical model that utilizes a Heaviside step function, as well as a pin-force model to compute the contractile force of a living cell, (2) deriving an expression of cell-membrane potential based on Laplace and Fourier Transform and their Inverse Transform functions by encountering Warburg diffusion impedance factor, (3) nano-fabricating novel biomechatronic platforms with associated microelectronics and customized software that extract cellular physics and mechanics, (4) developing a label-free biomarker, (5) arrive at a proved theorem in developing a mathematical expression in relating cancer cell mechanobiology to its biophysics in connection to the stage of the disease, and (6) to the first time in literature, and to the best of the authors' knowledge, discriminating different stages and morphology of cancer cell melanoma based on their cell-membrane potentials, and associated contractile forces that could introduce a new venue of cellular therapeutic modalities, preclinical early cancer diagnosis, and a novel approach in immunotherapy drug development. The proposed innovative technology-based versatile bio-mechatronic platforms shall be extended for future studies, investigating the role of electrochemical signaling of the nervous system in cancer formation that will significantly impact modern oncology by pursuing a targeted immunotherapy approach. This work also provides a robust platform for immunotherapy practitioners in extending the study of cellular biophysics in stalling neural-cancer interactions, of which the FDA-approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies can be enhanced (genetically engineered) in a lab by improving its receptors to capture cancer antigens. This work amplifies the importance of studying neurotransmitters and electrochemical signaling molecules in shaping the immune T-cell function and its effectiveness in arresting cancer proliferation rate (mechanobiology mechanism).",1
39621338,β-Blocker Use and Delayed Onset and Progression of Huntington Disease.,"Huntington disease (HD) is characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric decline. β-Blockers may play a therapeutic role by decreasing enhanced sympathetic tone in HD. To evaluate the impact of β-blockers on the timing of motor diagnosis onset and progression of HD symptoms. This observational, longitudinal multicenter study used the Enroll-HD platform database (initiated September 2011 to present), including propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with premanifest HD (preHD) and early motor-manifest HD (mmHD) who were either users or nonusers of β-blockers. Participants included patients with genetically confirmed preHD (n = 4683 eligible participants) or mmHD (n = 3024 eligible participants) who were taking a β-blocker and were matched to similar non-β-blocker users. Uninterrupted use of a β-blocker for more than 1 year. For PreHD: risk of receiving a motor diagnosis of HD over time. For mmHD: progression rate of total motor score, total functional capacity score, and the symbol digit modalities test. Post hoc analyses were performed to test additional clarifying hypotheses after the primary analyses were completed. This study included 174 preHD β-blocker users (59 males; 115 females) with a mean age of 46.4 (SD, 13.1) years and a mean cytosine-adenine guanine repeat length of 41.1 (SD, 2.4) who were well matched to 174 preHD non-β-blocker users. The preHD β-blocker users showed a statistically significant reduction in the annualized hazard of receiving a motor diagnosis compared with nonusers (n = 174) (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94; P = .02). There were 149 mmHD β-blocker users (86 males; 60 females) with a mean age of 58.9 (SD, 11.3) years and a mean cytosine-adenine guanine repeat length of 42.0 (SD, 2.3) matched to 149 mmHD non-β-blocker users. The β-blocker users had a slower mean annualized worsening in total motor score (mean difference [MD], -0.45; 95% CI, -0.85 to -0.06; q = 0.025), total functional capacity score (MD, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.18; q = 0.025), and symbol digit modalities test (MD, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.10-0.56; q = 0.017) compared with matched nonusers. In this study, β-blocker use was associated with delayed motor onset in preHD and reduced the rate of worsening of symptoms in mmHD. These findings demonstrated that β-blockers may have a therapeutic role in HD but further studies are required.",1
39620843,Neuroimaging in Dementia.,"This article captures the current literature regarding the use of neuroimaging measures to study neurodegenerative diseases, including early- and late-onset Alzheimer disease, vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal lobar degeneration disorders, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia. In particular, the article highlights significant recent changes in novel therapeutics now available for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and in defining neurodegenerative disease using biological frameworks. Studies summarized include those using structural and functional MRI (fMRI) techniques, as well as metabolic and molecular emission tomography imaging (ie, positron emission tomography [PET] and single-photon emission computerized tomography [SPECT]). Neuroimaging measures are considered essential biomarkers for the detection and diagnosis of most neurodegenerative diseases. The recent approval of anti-amyloid antibody therapies has highlighted the importance of MRI and PET techniques in treatment eligibility and monitoring for associated side effects. Given the success of the initial biomarker-based classification system for Alzheimer disease (the amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration [A/T/N] framework), researchers in vascular cognitive impairment have created similar techniques for biomarker-based diagnosis. Further, the A/T/N framework for Alzheimer disease has been updated to include several pathologic targets for biomarker detection. Neurodegenerative diseases have a major health impact on millions of patients around the world. Neuroimaging biomarkers are rapidly becoming major diagnostic tools for the detection, monitoring, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This article educates readers about the current literature surrounding the use of neuroimaging tools in neurodegenerative diseases along with recent important developments in the field.",1
39617767,Development of a remote therapeutic monitoring platform: applications for movement disorders.,"Digital health tools are emerging as a promising solution for optimizing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), addressing challenges of therapy maintenance, care access, and discrete assessments. Wearable technology and mobile health platforms can offer remote monitoring capabilities, allowing for real-time virtual programming with optimization of patients' therapy, use of digital biomarkers that can help identify the onset, symptoms, medication-related fluctuations and side-effects, and response to DBS treatment. Through an investigational remote monitoring application (RM app) integrating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective data using wearables, we aimed to develop an accessible, data-driven digital tool to monitor patient symptoms and deliver low-burden and easy-to-access DBS therapy. The platform is designed to be compatible with several consumer-grade wearables and ensures patient data privacy and security. We conducted a feasibility study to test the tool's effectiveness in a large-scale DBS study, where subjects received a home-monitoring kit consisting of an iPhone and Apple Watch, pre-configured with the RM app to enable remote data collection. Compliance in this paper is defined as adherence to the RM app and Apple watch usage. Analysis of 67 subjects from the study demonstrated an average compliance rate of 63.3% for daily check-ins, 85.5% for monthly surveys and 61.9% for passive data with an average of 55 days of post-implant data. The study highlights the feasibility of frequent monitoring in the early post-implant period that could lead to optimal outcomes for patients. The platform developed can further optimize study execution and be extended to other chronic conditions treated with neuromodulation implants such as depression and pain.",1
39617167,Retinopathy in Parkinson's disease: A potential biomarker for early diagnosis and clinical assessment.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, originating from the substantia nigra pars compacta, and characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms such as anxiety, depression, reduced sense of smell, cognitive impairment, and visual dysfunction. Emerging evidence highlights the retina as a promising site for non-invasive exploration of PD pathology, due to its shared embryonic origin with the central nervous system. In recent years, with the development of ophthalmic technology, the acquisition of retinal-related function and structure has gradually become mature. PD-related retinal changes have become a research hotspot for non-motor symptoms of PD. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of retinal dysfunctions in PD, focusing on structural and functional changes as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and clinical assessment. By integrating findings from advanced imaging and electrophysiological studies, this review introduces novel perspectives on the correlation between retinal changes and PD pathophysiology, offering innovative approaches for early detection, disease progression monitoring, and therapeutic stratification.",1
39614911,Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes.,"In this narrative review, we address mild cognitive impairment, a frequent complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs). Recent diagnostic criteria have blurred the lines between PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly in the cognitive domain. Additionally, atypical parkinsonian syndromes like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) often present with significant cognitive decline. Even multiple system atrophy (MSA) can be associated with cognitive impairment in some cases. Several biomarkers, including imaging techniques, such brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), as well as pathological proteins either of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as Tau, amyloid beta, and synuclein, or of the serum, such as neurofilament light chain (Nfl) are more and more often utilized in the early differential diagnosis of APDs. The complex interplay between these conditions and the evolving understanding of their underlying pathologies highlight the need for further research to refine diagnostic criteria, possibly incorporate the new findings from the biomarker's field into the diagnostic criteria and develop targeted therapeutic strategies.",1
39614747,ADNI Biomarker Core: A review of progress since 2004 and future challenges.,"We describe the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Biomarker Core major activities from October 2004 to March 2024, including biobanking ADNI cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and serum biofluid samples, biofluid analyses for Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the Biomarker Core and various non-ADNI laboratories, and continuous assessments of pre-analytics. Validated immunoassay and mass spectrometry-based assays were performed in CSF with a shift to plasma, a more accessible biofluid, as qualified assays became available. Performance comparisons across different CSF and plasma AD biomarker measurement platforms have enriched substantially the ADNI participant database enabling method performance determinations for AD pathology detection and longitudinal assessments of disease progression. Close collaboration with academic and industrial partners in the validation and implementation of AD biomarkers for early detection of disease pathology in treatment trials and ultimately in clinical practice is a key factor for the success of the work done in the Biomarker Core. Describe ADNI Biomarker Core biobanking and sample distribution from 2007 to 2024. Discuss validated mass spectrometry and immunoassay methods for ADNI biofluid analyses. Review collaborations with academic and industrial partners to detect AD and progression. Discuss major challenges, and progress to date, for co-pathology detection.

39613827,MJF-14 proximity ligation assay detects early non-inclusion alpha-synuclein pathology with enhanced specificity and sensitivity.,"α-Synuclein proximity ligation assay (PLA) has proved a sensitive technique for detection of non-Lewy body α-synuclein aggregate pathology. Here, we describe the MJF-14 PLA, a new PLA towards aggregated α-synuclein with unprecedented specificity, using the aggregate-selective α-synuclein antibody MJFR-14-6-4-2 (hereafter MJF-14). Signal in the assay correlates with α-synuclein aggregation in cell culture and human neurons, induced by α-synuclein overexpression or pre-formed fibrils. Co-labelling of MJF-14 PLA and pS129-α-synuclein immunofluorescence in post-mortem cases of dementia with Lewy bodies shows that while the MJF-14 PLA reveals extensive non-inclusion pathology, it is not sensitive towards pS129-α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies. In Parkinson's disease brain, direct comparison of PLA and immunohistochemistry with the MJF-14 antibody shows widespread α-synuclein pathology preceding the formation of conventional Lewy pathology. In conclusion, we introduce an improved α-synuclein aggregate PLA to uncover abundant non-inclusion pathology, which deserves future validation with brain bank resources and in different synucleinopathies.",1
39613471,White Matter Microstructure Alteration in Patients with Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: A Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics.,"This research aimed to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism of how drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) affects the integrity of the white matter (WM) fiber microstructure as measured by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor image (DTI) fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). We recruited 17 participants diagnosed with DIP, 20 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, and 16 normal controls (NCs) with a similar age, gender, and years of education. Subsequently, all participants underwent DTI magnetic resonance imaging scanning. To analyze the data, we utilized the software packages Functional MRI of the Brain Centre (FMRIB) Diffusion Toolbox (FDT), developed by the FMRIB laboratory at Oxford University, and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). The Argentina Hyposmia Rating Scale (AHRS) scores of patients in DIP group were markedly higher than those in PD patients group. Compared with the NC group, the FA values in the genu and body of the corpus callosum (CC), anterior limb of the right internal capsule, bilateral anterior corona radiata, bilateral superior corona radiata, right external capsule, and right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (could be a part of the anterior internal capsule) were significantly decreased in the DIP group; however, no significant cluster was found in MD. The present study provides novel insights into the alterations in WM microstructure among DIP patients, suggesting that these methodologies have the potential to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of DIP.",1
39609533,Semi automatic quantification of REM sleep without atonia in natural sleep environment.,"Polysomnography, the gold standard diagnostic tool in sleep medicine, is performed in an artificial environment. This might alter sleep and may not accurately reflect typical sleep patterns. While macro-structures are sensitive to environmental effects, micro-structures remain more stable. In this study we applied semi-automated algorithms to capture REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) and sleep spindles, comparing lab and home measurements. We analyzed 107 full-night recordings from 55 subjects: 24 healthy adults, 28 Parkinson's disease patients (15 RBD), and three with isolated Rem sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Sessions were manually scored. An automatic algorithm for quantifying RSWA was developed and tested against manual scoring. RSWAi showed a 60% correlation between home and lab. RBD detection achieved 83% sensitivity, 79% specificity, and 81% balanced accuracy. The algorithm accurately quantified RSWA, enabling the detection of RBD patients. These findings could facilitate more accessible sleep testing, and provide a possible alternative for screening RBD.",1
39608272,Retinal structure guidance-and-adaption network for early Parkinson's disease recognition based on OCT images.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a leading neurodegenerative disease globally. Precise and objective PD diagnosis is significant for early intervention and treatment. Recent studies have shown significant correlations between retinal structure information and PD based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, providing another potential means for early PD recognition. However, how to exploit the retinal structure information (e.g., thickness and mean intensity) from different retinal layers to improve PD recognition performance has not been studied before. Motivated by the above observations, we first propose a structural prior knowledge extraction (SPKE) module to obtain the retinal structure feature maps; then, we develop a structure-guided-and-adaption attention (SGDA) module to fully leverage the potential of different retinal layers based on the extracted retinal structure feature maps. By embedding SPKE and SGDA modules at the low stage of deep neural networks (DNNs), a retinal structure-guided-and-adaption network (RSGA-Net) is constructed for early PD recognition based on OCT images. The extensive experiments on a clinical OCT-PD dataset demonstrate the superiority of RSGA-Net over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide a visual analysis to explain how retinal structure information affects the decision-making process of DNNs.",1
39606516,Frequent and Unexplained Falls: A Case of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the most common neurodegenerative form of atypical parkinsonism. Although its prevalence has increased recently, it remains underdiagnosed. PSP is characterized by parkinsonism, downward gaze disorder, and a tendency to fall due to degeneration of the basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. Various clinical presentations have been linked to this entity, often making its diagnosis difficult, which can take three to four years to be established. PSP diagnosis mainly relies on clinical data and can only be confirmed with the neuropathological findings at autopsy. However, as per recent research, neuroimaging, namely brain MRI, can aid in an earlier diagnosis. We report the case of an 85-year-old female with a history of recurrent and unexplained falls over the last two years that had been wrongly attributed to Parkinson's disease (PD). She initially presented complaining of recurring falls associated with retropulsion movements that got progressively worse and eventually was not able to walk on her own. Concomitantly, there was also a cognitive dysfunction with frontal predominance. An exhaustive physical examination and clinical history revealed indicators consistent with PSP. PSP diagnosis demands a high clinical suspicion, and hence clinicians should have a good understanding of this disease for its early recognition. Although it is a devastating disorder, and no medications that can reverse the disease course are currently available, early diagnosis of PSP may contribute to improving the quality of life of the patients and their families, and prevent complications. This report highlights the clinically significant improvement in motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms when a multidisciplinary medical team is involved in the care of a PSP patient.",1
39600096,MGA-related syndrome: A proposed novel disorder.,"MGA (OMIM: 616061) encodes a dual-specificity transcription factor that regulates the expression of Max-network and T-box family target genes, important in embryogenesis. Previous studies have linked MGA to various phenotypes, including neurodevelopmental disorders, congenital heart disease, and early-onset Parkinson's disease. Here, we describe the clinical phenotype of individuals with de novo, heterozygous predicted loss-of-function variants in MGA, suggesting a unique disorder involving both neurodevelopmental and congenital anomalies. In addition to developmental delays, certain congenital anomalies were present in all individuals in this cohort including cardiac anomalies, male genital malformations, and craniofacial dysmorphisms. Additional findings seen in multiple individuals in this cohort include hypotonia, abnormal brain imaging, hearing loss, sleep dysfunction, urinary issues, skeletal abnormalities, and feeding difficulties. These findings provide support for MGA as a gene intolerant to protein truncation with a broad phenotypic spectrum.",1
39596523,In Vitro Cell Model Investigation of Alpha-Synuclein Aggregate Morphology Using Spectroscopic Imaging.,"Recently, it has been hypothesized that alpha-synuclein protein strain morphology may be associated with clinical subtypes of alpha-synucleinopathies, like Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. However, direct evidence is lacking due to the caveat of conformation-specific characterization of protein strain morphology. Here we present a new cell model based in vitro method to explore various alpha-synuclein (αsyn) aggregate morphotypes. We performed a spectroscopic investigation of the HEK293 cell model, transfected with human wildtype-αsyn and A53T-αsyn variants, using the amyloid fibril-specific heptameric luminescent oligomeric thiophene h-FTAA. The spectral profile of h-FTAA binding to aggregates displayed a blue-shifted spectrum with a fluorescence decay time longer than in PBS, suggesting a hydrophobic binding site. In vitro spectroscopic binding characterization of h-FTAA with αsyn pre-formed fibrils suggested a binding dissociation constant K",1
39596444,Parkinson's Disease: Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Disease Progression.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that causes both motor and nonmotor symptoms. While our understanding of putative mechanisms has advanced significantly, it remains challenging to verify biomarkers with sufficient evidence for regular clinical use. Clinical symptoms are the primary basis for diagnosing the disease, which can be mild in the early stages and overlap with other neurological disorders. As a result, clinical testing and medical records are mostly relied upon for diagnosis, posing substantial challenges during both the initial diagnosis and the continuous disease monitoring. Recent biochemical, neuroimaging, and genetic biomarkers have helped us understand the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. This comprehensive study focuses on these biomarkers, which were chosen based on their relevance, methodological excellence, and contribution to the field. Biochemical biomarkers, including α-synuclein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), can predict disease severity and progression. The dopaminergic system is widely used as a neuroimaging biomarker to diagnose PD. Numerous genes and genome wide association study (GWAS) sites have been related to the development of PD. Recent research on the SNCA gene and leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2 (LRRK2) has shown promising results. By evaluating current studies, this review intends to uncover gaps in biomarker validation and use, while also highlighting promising improvements. It emphasizes the need for dependable and reproducible indicators in improving PD diagnosis and prognosis. These biomarkers may open up new avenues for early diagnosis, disease progression tracking, and the development of personalized treatment programs.",1
39595812,Exosome Cargo in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Leveraging Their Intercellular Communication Capabilities for Biomarker Discovery and Therapeutic Delivery.,"The inexorable progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, is closely related to irreversible brain decline. Accurately characterizing pathophysiological features and identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and optimized treatment are critical. Hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), obtaining sensitive monitoring indicators for disease progression and achieving efficient drug delivery remain significant challenges. Exosomes, endogenous nanoscale vesicles that carry key bioactive substances, reflect the intracellular environment and play an important role in cell signaling. They have shown promise in traversing the BBB, serving dual roles as potential biomarkers for NDs and vehicles for targeted drug delivery. However, the specific mechanisms by which exosome influence NDs are not fully understood, necessitating further investigation into their attributes and functionalities in the context of NDs. This review explores how exosomes mediate multifaceted interactions, particularly in exacerbating pathogenic processes such as oxidative stress, neuronal dysfunction, and apoptosis integral to NDs. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the profound impact of exosomes under stress and disease states, assessing their prospective utility as biomarkers and drug delivery vectors, offering new perspectives for tackling these challenging diseases.",1
39590351,Parkinson's Disease: A Narrative of the Evolving Understanding of the Role of α-Synuclein in Screening.,"The present investigation aims to examine the role of α-synuclein seed amplification assays for screening Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, leading to symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia, postural instability, dementia, and depression. It is classified as an α-synucleinopathy related to the role of α-synuclein aggregates in neuron degeneration. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment without premortem diagnostic tests or imaging, often resulting in delayed detection and impaired symptom management. In this regard, our study explores a screening technique using an amplification assay to measure α-synuclein levels in cerebrospinal fluid, which could potentially identify early pathological changes and improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. While preliminary results are promising, further studies are needed to evaluate this approach's accuracy and clinical feasibility. A review of numerous trials demonstrates that α-synuclein seeding amplification assays (SAA) are a highly reliable, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tool for PD. This assay offers a promising opportunity to improve early diagnosis and quantify severity, especially for asymptomatic individuals or those with a family history of PD, allowing for earlier intervention and more effective disease management. In summary, the emerging body of evidence supporting α-synuclein as a biomarker should allow patients with PD to be detected and treated sooner, enhancing patients' quality of life and potentially changing the disease trajectory.",1
39586209,Biosensing systems for the detection of biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases: A review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) are pathologies associated with neuronal disorders and degradation. They are difficult to detect in their early stages, when it is crucial for appropriate treatment to be implemented. Currently, many biosensors are being developed to enable the determination of compounds characteristic of the aforementioned diseases. This review includes a de-scription of the structure of biosensors, as well as their applications in many areas of qualitative and quantitative analysis, with particular emphasis on diagnostics. The structures of biosensors that can potentially be used for the diagnosis of AD, PD and MS are discussed, as well as their characteristics, which depend on the technique used for the analysis and the type of recognition element capable of specifically binding a given biomarker. A description is also given of biosensors classified according to the type of sample used for quantitative determinations.",1
39584936,Documentation of prodromal features and risk factors of dementia disease in primary care practice.,"Documented risk factors and prodromal features of dementia in primary care practices may support dementia prevention and early detection in routine care. To identify documented prodromal features and risk factors of dementia before the incident dementia diagnosis in German primary care practices. This case-control study used documented diagnoses (risk factors, prodromal features) and prescriptions of primary care practices for 73,717 patients with dementia disease and 73,717 matched controls (ratio 1:1). Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between these documentations and the development of dementia diseases within 12 (1 year), 12-60 (1-5 years), and 60-120 months (5-10 years) before the incident dementia diagnosis. Mild cognitive impairment, depression, symptoms involving the emotional state, dizziness, and age-related physical debility were documented prodromal features associated with developing dementia diagnosis across all periods. Difficulties in gait and mobility and conduct disorders occurred significantly more often five years before the diagnosis. In terms of documented risk factors, hearing loss, visual disturbances, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular diseases were associated with dementia across all periods. Mental and behavioral disorders due to the use of alcohol, intracranial injury, Parkinson's disease, chronic fatigue, intellectual disabilities, pneumonia, and epilepsy were also more often documented 60 months before the diagnosis. Next to mild cognitive deficits, several factors, such as disorders of conduct and emotions, gait, mobility, and mental health, can be identified and monitored in primary care practices, helping physicians focus on potential consequences for cognitive decline and subsequent dementia.",1
39578305,Risk factors for delirium occurring after deep brain stimulation surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Postoperative delirium (POD) may cause cognitive morbidities and prolonged hospital stay. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with postoperative delirium in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). We retrospectively reviewed 83 patients with idiopathic PD who underwent bilateral DBS between 2016 and 2023. The target of DBS was the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in 84.3% and 15.7% of patients, respectively. Patients were evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and categorized into two groups: those with delirium and those without. Demographic features, disease duration, preoperative cognitive status (Mini-Mental State Examination) and silent ischemia, brain atrophy rates, DBS target location, surgical type and duration, Unified PD Rating Scale-3 scores, Hoehn and Yahr scores, postoperative perilead edema, and electrolyte imbalance were compared between patients with and without post-DBS delirium. Apart from univariate analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for disease duration and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors for post-DBS delirium. Five out of the 83 patients (6%) developed post-DBS delirium. Age (> 68 years), disease duration, preoperative cerebral atrophy rates, and postoperative perilead edema were significantly higher in patients who developed delirium (p < 0.05 each). The ROC curve analysis revealed disease duration of ≥ 11 years as a risk factor for delirium (p = 0.001; odds ratio, OR: 58.4, 95% confidence interval, CI: 5.45-625.49). Age and disease duration were independent risk factors for post-DBS delirium (OR: 1.243, 95% CI: 1.070-1.592 and OR: 22.52, 95% CI: 1.21-383.96, respectively). Older age and longer disease duration are independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in patients with PD. This study highlights the need to identify high-risk patients when undertaking DBS to facilitate early diagnosis and timely management.",1
39577925,"Multiple system atrophy: advances in pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.","Multiple system atrophy is an adult-onset, sporadic, and progressive neurodegenerative disease. People with this disorder report a wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Overlap in the clinical presentation of multiple system atrophy with other movement disorders (eg, Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy) is a concern for accurate and timely diagnosis. Over the past 5 years, progress has been made in understanding key pathophysiological events in multiple system atrophy, including the seeding of α-synuclein inclusions and the detection of disease-specific α-synuclein strains. Diagnostic criteria were revised in 2022 with the intention to improve the accuracy of a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy, particularly for early disease stages. Early signals of efficacy in clinical trials have indicated the potential for disease-modifying therapies for multiple system atrophy, although no trial has yet provided unequivocal evidence of neuroprotection in this rare disease. The advances in pathophysiology could play a part in biomarker discovery for early diagnosis as well as in the development of disease-modifying therapies.",1
39577923,Sensitivity and specificity of a seed amplification assay for diagnosis of multiple system atrophy: a multicentre cohort study.,"The pathological hallmarks of multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease are, respectively, misfolded-α-synuclein-laden glial cytoplasmic inclusions and Lewy bodies. CSF-soluble misfolded α-synuclein aggregates (seeds) are readily detected in people with Parkinson's disease by α-synuclein seed amplification assay (synSAA), but identification of seeds associated with multiple system atrophy for diagnostic purposes has proven elusive. We aimed to assess whether a novel synSAA could reliably distinguish seeds from Lewy bodies and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. In this multicentre cohort study, a novel synSAA that multiplies and detects seeds by fluorescence was used to analyse masked CSF and brain samples from participants with either clinically diagnosed or pathology-confirmed multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, isolated rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (IRBD), disorders that were not synucleinopathies, or healthy controls. Participants were from eight available cohorts from seven medical centres in four countries: New York Brain Bank, New York, USA (NYBB); University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA (UPENN); Paracelsus-Elena-Klinik, Kassel, Germany (DeNoPa and KAMSA); Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Spain (BARMSA); Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany (EKUT); Göteborgs Universitet, Göteborgs, Sweden (UGOT); and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (KIMSA). Clinical cohorts were classified for expected diagnostic accuracy as either research (longitudinal follow-up visits) or real-life (single visit). Sensitivity and specificity were estimated according to pathological (gold standard) and clinical (reference standard) diagnoses. In 23 brain samples (from the NYBB cohort), those containing Lewy bodies were synSAA-positive and produced high fluorescence amplification patterns (defined as type 1); those containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions were synSAA-positive and produced intermediate fluorescence (defined as type 2); and those without α-synuclein pathology produced below-threshold fluorescence and were synSAA-negative. In 21 pathology-confirmed CSF samples (from the UPENN cohort), those with Lewy bodies were synSAA-positive type 1; those with glial cytoplasmic inclusions were synSAA-positive type 2; and those with four-repeat tauopathy were synSAA-negative. In the DeNoPa research cohort (which had no samples from people with multiple system atrophy), the novel synSAA had sensitivities of 95% (95% CI 88-99) for 80 participants with Parkinson's disease and 95% (76-100) for 21 participants with IRBD, and a specificity of 95% (86-99) for 60 healthy controls. Overall (combining BARMSA, EKUT, KAMSA, UGOT, and KIMSA cohorts that were enriched for cases of multiple system atrophy), the novel synSAA had 87% sensitivity for multiple system atrophy (95% CI 80-93) and specificity for type 2 seeds was 77% (67-85). For participants with multiple system atrophy just in research cohorts (BARMSA and EKUT), the novel synSAA had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 71-92) and a specificity for type 2 seeds of 87% (74-95), whereas cases from real-life cohorts (KAMSA, KIMSA, and UGOT) had a sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 80-97) but a decreased specificity for type 2 seeds of 68% (53-81). The novel synSAA produced amplification patterns that enabled the identification of underlying α-synuclein pathology, showing two levels of fluorescence that corresponded with different pathological hallmarks of synucleinopathy. The synSAA might be useful for early diagnosis of synucleinopathies in clinical trials, and potentially for clinical use, but additional formal validation work is needed.

39577922,Timeline to symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in people with Down syndrome as assessed by amyloid-PET and tau-PET: a longitudinal cohort study.,"Adults with Down syndrome are at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Natural history cohort studies have characterised the progression of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in people with Down syndrome, with a focus on amyloid β-PET and tau-PET. In this study, we aimed to leverage these well characterised imaging biomarkers in a large cohort of individuals with Down syndrome, to examine the timeline to symptomatic Alzheimer's disease based on estimated years since the detection on PET of amyloid β-positivity, referred to here as amyloid age, and in relation to tau burden as assessed by PET. In this prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study, data were collected at four university research sites in the UK and USA as part of the Alzheimer's Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS) study. Eligible participants were aged 25 years or older with Down syndrome, had a mental age of at least 3 years (based on a standardised intelligence quotient test), and had trisomy 21 (full, mosaic, or translocation) confirmed through karyotyping. Participants were assessed twice between 2017 and 2022, with approximately 32 months between visits. Participants had amyloid-PET and tau-PET scans, and underwent cognitive assessment with the modified Cued Recall Test (mCRT) and the Down Syndrome Mental Status Examination (DSMSE) to assess cognitive functioning. Study partners completed the National Task Group-Early Detection Screen for Dementia (NTG-EDSD). Generalised linear models were used to assess the association between amyloid age (whereby 0 years equated to 18 centiloids) and mCRT, DSMSE, NTG-EDSD, and tau PET at baseline and the 32-month follow-up. Broken stick regression was used to identify the amyloid age that corresponded to decreases in cognitive performance and increases in tau PET after the onset of amyloid β positivity. 167 adults with Down syndrome, of whom 92 had longitudinal data, were included in our analyses. Generalised linear regressions showed significant quadratic associations between amyloid age and cognitive performance and cubic associations between amyloid age and tau, both at baseline and at the 32-month follow-up. Using broken stick regression models, differences in mCRT total scores were detected beginning 2·7 years (95% credible interval [CrI] 0·2 to 5·4; equating to 29·8 centiloids) after the onset of amyloid β positivity in cross-sectional models. Based on cross-sectional data, increases in tau deposition started a mean of 2·7-6·1 years (equating to 29·8-47·9 centiloids) after the onset of amyloid β positivity. Mild cognitive impairment was observed at a mean amyloid age of 7·4 years (SD 6·6; equating to 56·8 centiloids) and dementia was observed at a mean amyloid age of 12·7 years (5·6; equating to 97·4 centiloids). There is a short timeline to initial cognitive decline and dementia from onset of amyloid β positivity and tau deposition in people with Down syndrome. This newly established timeline based on amyloid age (or equivalent centiloid values) is important for clinical practice and informing the design of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials, and it avoids the limitations of timelines based on chronological age.

39576630,Modifications of DJ-1 in which pI shifts to acidic in red blood cells a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease at early stages.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, the incidence of which increases with age. However, since there is no fundamental treatment or methods for early diagnosis, new methods of treatment and diagnosis are urgently needed. We focused on post-translational modifications of DJ-1, which is encoded by the familial PD-causative gene  DJ-1 with acidic modifications increased in red blood cells at early stages of PD.DJ-1 with acidic modifications can be used as a biomarker for PD.Cys53 and Cys106 are involved in the modifications of DJ-1 in PD.",1
39574848,"Prediction, prognosis and monitoring of neurodegeneration at biobank-scale via machine learning and imaging.","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative conditions. These central nervous system disorders impact both the structure and function of the brain and may lead to imaging changes that precede symptoms. Patients with ADRD or PD have long asymptomatic phases that exhibit significant heterogeneity. Hence, quantitative measures that can provide early disease indicators are necessary to improve patient stratification, clinical care, and clinical trial design. This work uses machine learning techniques to derive such a quantitative marker from T1-weighted (T1w) brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this retrospective study, we developed machine learning (ML) based disease-specific scores based on T1w brain MRI utilizing Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We evaluated the potential of ML-based scores for early diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ADRD and PD in an independent large-scale population-based longitudinal cohort, UK Biobank. 1,826 dementia images from 731 participants, 3,161 healthy control images from 925 participants from the ADNI cohort, 684 PD images from 319 participants, and 232 healthy control images from 145 participants from the PPMI cohort were used to train machine learning models. The classification performance is 0.94 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96] area under the ROC Curve (AUC) for ADRD detection and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.57-0.71] for PD detection using 790 extracted structural brain features. The most predictive regions include the hippocampus and temporal brain regions in ADRD and the substantia nigra in PD. The normalized ML model's probabilistic output (ADRD and PD imaging scores) was evaluated on 42,835 participants with imaging data from the UK Biobank. There are 66 cases for ADRD and 40 PD cases whose T1 brain MRI is available during pre-diagnostic phases. For diagnosis occurrence events within 5 years, the integrated survival model achieves a time-dependent AUC of 0.86 [95% CI: 0.80-0.92] for dementia and 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.94] for PD. ADRD imaging score is strongly associated with dementia-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.76 [95% CI: 1.50-2.05] per S.D. of imaging score), and PD imaging score shows association with PD-free survival (hazard ratio 2.33 [95% CI: 1.55-3.50]) in our integrated model. HR and prevalence increased stepwise over imaging score quartiles for PD, demonstrating heterogeneity. As a proxy for diagnosis, we validated AD/PD polygenic risk scores of 42,835 subjects against the imaging scores, showing a highly significant association after adjusting for covariates. In both the PPMI and ADNI cohorts, the scores are associated with clinical assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and pathological markers, which include amyloid and tau. Finally, imaging scores are associated with polygenic risk scores for multiple diseases. Our results suggest that we can use imaging scores to assess the genetic architecture of such disorders in the future. Our study demonstrates the use of quantitative markers generated using machine learning techniques for ADRD and PD. We show that disease probability scores obtained from brain structural features are useful for early detection, prognosis prediction, and monitoring disease progression.

39574205,α-Synuclein seeding amplification assays for diagnosing synucleinopathies: an innovative tool in clinical implementation.,"The spectrum of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is characterized by α-synuclein (αSyn) pathology, which serves as the definitive diagnostic marker. However, current diagnostic methods primarily rely on motor symptoms that manifest years after the initial neuropathological changes, thereby delaying potential treatment. The symptomatic overlap between PD and MSA further complicates the diagnosis, highlighting the need for precise and differential diagnostic methods for these overlapping neurodegenerative diseases. αSyn misfolding and aggregation occur before clinical symptoms appear, suggesting that detection of pathological αSyn could enable early molecular diagnosis of synucleinopathies. Recent advances in seed amplification assay (SAA) offer a tool for detecting neurodegenerative diseases by identifying αSyn misfolding in fluid and tissue samples, even at preclinical stages. Extensive research has validated the effectiveness and reproducibility of SAAs for diagnosing synucleinopathies, with ongoing efforts focusing on optimizing conditions for detecting pathological αSyn in more accessible samples and identifying specific αSyn species to differentiate between various synucleinopathies. This review offers a thorough overview of SAA technology, exploring its applications for diagnosing synucleinopathies, addressing the current challenges, and outlining future directions for its clinical use.",1
39567959,Parkinson's disease in the Lebanese population: knowledge and attitude scales' validation and correlates.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative neurological disorder that negatively affects the quality of life of affected individuals as well as their care givers. There is limited information in both epidemiological data and awareness level on PD in the Middle East. Considering the increasing prevalence of PD, the lack of awareness and negative attitudes toward PD pose a barrier in the provision of appropriate care for individuals with PD. This study aimed to validate scales to explore the knowledge and attitude towards PD among the general population in Lebanon and identify the associated factors related to the knowledge and attitude assessment. This study's results would guide awareness strategies in the country including public health strategies, campaigns and education sessions for the general population as well as targeted people. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between July and September 2023 in Lebanon. Snowball sampling was used to recruit 400 Lebanese adults living in Lebanon. The validity and reliability of the knowledge and attitude scales were assessed, followed by a thorough statistical analysis to explore the factors associated with these scales. The knowledge and attitude scales generated by this study were valid and reliable; Cronbach's alpha values for knowledge and attitude scales were 0.697 and 0.901, respectively. Using these scales, 91.8% demonstrated inappropriate knowledge and 93% showed positive attitude towards PD. Higher knowledge scores were significantly associated with female gender (Beta = 1.130), being a healthcare professional (Beta = 2.514), having heard about PD (Beta = 5.338), obtaining the source of information from electronic databases (Beta = 1.283), from pharmacist or physician (Beta = 1.212), from personal readings (Beta = 2.386), and having PD or knowing someone with PD; a friend or a family member (Beta = 1.179). However, being illiterate or having primary or secondary education (Beta = -0.874), having a higher household crowding index (Beta = -1.890), not knowing if contents from sources provide negative images about PD (Beta = - 1.908) and preferring not to say to which social class they belong (Beta = - 1.602) were significantly associated with lower knowledge scores. Believing that contents from sources provide negative images about PD (Beta = 8.246) was significantly associated with a higher attitude score, i.e., a more negative attitude towards PD. This study showed low levels of knowledge and an overall positive attitude towards PD in Lebanon. Factors associated with higher knowledge and attitude scores, including gender, education level, profession, knowing someone with the disease, household crowding index, social class, source of information and contents of such sources, reflect the need to consider those when implementing targeted corrective actions. Future studies can focus on educational campaigns to improve public awareness, reduce misconceptions and limit barriers to the early diagnosis and provision of optimal care to the affected patients.",1
39567305,Parkinson's disease subtypes: Approaches and clinical implications.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with significant heterogeneity in disease presentation and progression. Subtype identification remains a top priority in the field of PD clinical research. Several PD subtypes have been identified. Hypothesis-driven subtypes refer to pre-defined subtypes based on specific criteria. Under hypothesis-driven subtypes, motor subtypes are the most common empirical subtype in both research and clinical settings. The concept of the non-motor symptoms (NMS) subtypes is relatively new and less well studied. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is one of the more prevalent NMS subtypes of PD. Data-driven subtyping is a hypothesis-free approach, that defines disease phenotypes by comprehensively evaluating multidimensional data. In this review, we summarize the main features for the different PD subtypes: from hypothesis-driven subtypes to data-driven subtypes. NMS and data-driven subtypes are still not yet well understood particularly with regard to biomarker and progression characterization. Future PD subtyping based on specific biological makers will enable us to better reflect the underlying pathophysiological underpinnings and enhance our search for specific therapeutic targets. The goal is to develop a simple algorithm to subtype PD patients at an early stage of PD that will enable good prognostication of their disease course, targeted therapies to be delivered, and proactive prevention of complications. Understanding PD subtypes and heterogeneity will also guide future clinical trial design and aid clinicians to better manage PD patients that will enable targeted disease surveillance and personalized treatment.

39557982,Optimizing early diagnosis by integrating multiple classifiers for predicting brain stroke and critical diseases.,"Machine learning has gained attention in the medical field. Continuous efforts are being made to develop robust models for early prognosis purposes. The brain is the most pivotal organ in the human body. A brain stroke is generally caused by a blockage in the brain arteries. A brain stroke is one of the primary reasons for death. Therefore, early prediction of diseases like brain stroke, heart attack can significantly help in making decisions for doctors. The research study aims to find a robust and potential technique for the early prediction of brain stroke, Alzheimer's, heart attack, cancer, Parkinson's and potentially reducing the incidence of severe post complications of the mentioned diseases. By considering the five datasets as input, machine learning models have been trained for the research study. Early prediction of brain stroke has been done using eight individual classifiers along with 56 other models which are designed by merging the pairs of individual models using soft and hard voting for brain stroke and eight individual classifiers have been used for early prediction of heart attack, cancer, Alzheimer and Parkinson's. After analyzing the results of each classifier for each disease, the proposed method, which is a pair of random forest and decision tree using a hard voting method for early brain stroke prediction, achieves the highest accuracy of 99%, which is better than all classifiers. Along with accuracy, the proposed method attained a value of 98% in precision, an outstanding 100% in recall, and 99% in F1 score. XGBoost performed best for cancer, Parkinson's, Alzeihmer's and Bernoulli naive bayes performed best in case of Heart attack .Upon comparing the values of these performance metrics, they outshine all the other model's values.",1
39550063,Combined graph convolutional networks with a multi-connection pattern to identify tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and Essential tremor with resting tremor.,"Essential tremor with resting tremor (rET) and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (tPD) share many similar clinical symptoms, leading to frequent misdiagnoses. Functional connectivity (FC) matrix analysis derived from resting-state functional MRI (Rs-fMRI) offers a promising approach for early diagnosis and for exploring FC network pathogenesis in rET and tPD. However, methods relying solely on a single connection pattern may overlook the complementary roles of different connectivity patterns, resulting in reduced diagnostic differentiation. Therefore, we propose a multi-pattern connection Graph Convolutional Network (MCGCN) method to integrate information from various connection modes, distinguishing between rET and healthy controls (HC), tPD and HC, and rET and tPD. We constructed FC matrices using three different connectivity modes for each subject and used these as inputs to the MCGCN model for disease classification. The classification performance of the model was evaluated for each connectivity mode. Subsequently, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to identify the most discriminative brain regions. The important brain regions identified were primarily distributed within cerebellar-motor and non-motor cortical networks. Compared with single-pattern GCN, our proposed MCGCN model demonstrated superior classification accuracy, underscoring the advantages of integrating multiple connectivity modes. Specifically, the model achieved an average accuracy of 88.0% for distinguishing rET from HC, 88.8% for rET from tPD, and 89.6% for tPD from HC. Our findings indicate that combining graph convolutional networks with multi-connection patterns can not only effectively discriminate between tPD, rET, and HC but also enhance our understanding of the functional network mechanisms underlying rET and tPD.",1
39545533,[Senses and dementia : sensory loss and dementia risk].,"In the course of several neurodegenerative conditions, the presence of a sensory alteration, even before the appearance of cognitive disorders or complaints concerning autonomy, can potentially lead to earlier diagnosis and more efficient management of these complex patients. The mechanisms underlying the association between sensory impairment and the risk of progression to dementia are increasingly better understood and should ultimately improve the accuracy of the diagnosis process for the most common neurodegenerative conditions, but also participate in the differential diagnosis between these conditions. Finally, early management of these sensory impairments offers a relatively easy way to modify patient's progression by delaying the onset of several symptoms during the progression towards a dementia syndrome. Au cours de plusieurs affections neurodégénératives, la présence d’une altération sensorielle, avant même l’apparition des troubles cognitifs ou des plaintes concernant l’autonomie, peut potentiellement ouvrir la voie à un diagnostic plus précoce et à une prise en charge plus efficiente de ces patients complexes. Les mécanismes qui sous-tendent cette association entre atteinte sensorielle et risque d’évolution vers une démence sont de mieux en mieux compris et devraient permettre, à terme, de poser un diagnostic plus précis de plusieurs affections neurodégénératives fréquentes, mais également de participer au diagnostic différentiel entre ces affections.

39543393,Discriminating Parkinson's disease patients from healthy controls using nasal respiratory airflow.,"Breathing patterns may inform on health. We note that the sites of earliest brain damage in Parkinson's disease (PD) house the neural pace-makers of respiration. We therefore hypothesized that ongoing long-term temporal dynamics of respiration may be altered in PD. We applied a wearable device that precisely logs nasal airflow over time in 28 PD patients (mostly H&Y stage-II) and 33 matched healthy controls. Each participant wore the device for 24 h of otherwise routine daily living. We observe significantly altered temporal patterns of nasal airflow in PD, where inhalations are longer and less variable than in matched controls (mean PD = -1.22 ± 1.9 (combined respiratory features score), Control = 1.04 ± 2.16, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, z = -4.1, effect size Cliff's δ = -0.61, 95% confidence interval = -0.79 - (-0.34), P = 4.3 × 10 We conclude that breathing patterns are altered by H&Y stage-II in the disease cascade, and our methods may be further refined in the future to provide an indication with diagnostic and prognostic value. In its earliest stages, Parkinson’s disease damages the parts of the brain that control breathing. We built a small device that measures airflow patterns through the nose over time. People with Parkinson’s disease and healthy individuals wore this device for 24 h. We found that nasal inhalations in Parkinson’s patients were longer and less variable than in healthy individuals. This difference was so pronounced that, using only 30 min of recording, we could accurately determine most people who had Parkinson’s disease and how severe their disease was. Future studies will determine whether this tool can contribute to early diagnosis, and it may be useful to monitor disease progression.",1
39542220,The broad spectrum of malignant syndromes.,"Malignant syndromes represent a group of medical conditions characterized by a rapid evolution of clinical manifestations, potentially leading to life-threatening complications if left untreated. These syndromes pose significant challenges for diagnosis and management, as they can lead to multisystem organ failure and death. Despite distinct features and origins, these syndromes share similar clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and the imperative for urgent medical intervention. While distinct mechanisms may initially trigger the different malignant syndromes, a final common pathway leading to similar signs and symptoms involves various neurotransmitter systems, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, glycinergic, and glutamatergic pathways. This narrative review examines the clinical presentations and potential causes of malignant syndromes, both highlighting shared pathophysiological mechanisms and emphasizing the critical importance of early recognition and intervention to mitigate potentially fatal outcomes. Although clinically heterogeneous, with variable motor and non-motor manifestations, most malignant syndromes share acute and rapid disruptions in physiological functions, including body temperature regulation, metabolism, control of the autonomic system and maintenance of consciousness. The potential for severe morbidity and mortality associated with these syndromes emphasizes the critical need for understanding their clinical characteristics, underlying mechanisms, and appropriate management strategies.",1
39541955,Disease Burden of Parkinson's Disease in Asia and Its 34 Countries and Territories from 1990 to 2021: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.,"The increasing global population and aging have made Parkinson's disease (PD) a significant public health concern. Comprehensive evaluations of PD burden trends in Asian subregions and countries are lacking. This study investigated PD burden in Asia from 1990 to 2021, categorized by age, sex, and region. Data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 were analyzed to assess the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) across five Asian subregions and 34 countries/territories, using joinpoint regression, decomposition analysis, frontier analysis, and Bayesian models to examine changes, influencing factors, and predict future trends. In 2021, the age-standardized PD incidence and prevalence in Asia were higher than the global average, particularly in East Asia (24.16 and 243.46/100,000, respectively). From 1990 to 2021, the incidence of PD in Asia rose by 198.01%, its prevalence rose by 284.35%, mortality rose by 111.27%, and DALY rose by 144.45%. Males consistently presented a greater PD burden than females did, with a growing sex gap over time. PD burden increased with age, especially among those aged 65 years and older. Population aging was the primary driver of new PD cases, and increasing etiological factors led to more patients. Inequalities in the PD burden have increased between high- and low-income areas, with low-income regions being more affected. By 2036, PD incidence is projected to increase in all subregions except the high-income Asia-Pacific region, with males experiencing a higher rate of increase. The PD burden in Asia has significantly increased over the past three decades, particularly in middle-aged and elderly males, middle- and low-SDI countries, and individuals already suffering from PD. The increasing incidence and aging population necessitate the reallocation of medical resources, improved chronic disease management systems, stronger public health interventions, and sustainable development efforts.

To understand their impact and research gaps, this study delineated the clinical progression of PD in recent years. Using Accelerating Medicine Partnership-PD (AMP-PD) data harmonized from seven biomarker discovery studies (2010-2020), we extracted: overall [Schwab and England (S&E), PD Questionnaire (PDQ-39)]; motor [Movement Disorders Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)-II and -III and Hoehn & Yahr (HY)]; and non-motor [MDS-UPDRS-I, University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)] scores. Age at diagnosis was set as 0 years, and data were tracked for 15 subsequent years. Among 3001 PD cases identified to be suitable for this study, 2838 are white, 1843 are males, with a mean age at diagnosis was 60.2 ± 10.3 years. At baseline evaluation, the disease duration was 9.9 ± 6.0 years overall, 1915 within 0-5, 541 with 6-10, 254 within 11-15, and 163 greater than 15 years. Participants largely reported independence (S&E, 5y: 86.6 ± 12.3; 10y: 78.9 ± 19.3; 15y: 78.5 ± 17.0) and good quality of life (PDQ-39, 5y: 15.5 ± 12.3; 10y: 22.1 ± 15.8; 15y: 24.3 ± 14.4). Motor scores displayed a linear progression, whereas non-motor scores plateaued ∼10-15 years. Younger onset age and female correlated with slower progression. Twenty-first century PD patients remain largely independent in the first decade of disease at tertiary subspecialty care and research centers. There are data gaps for those who are non-whites or longer PD duration, and sensible metrics that can gauge non-motor progression when PD is beyond 10 years.",1
39539721,Parkinson's disease detection from EEG signal employing autoencoder and RBFNN-based hybrid deep learning framework utilizing power spectral density.,"Early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) is essential for halting its progression, yet challenges remain in leveraging deep learning for accurate identification. This study aims to overcome these obstacles by introducing a hybrid deep learning approach that enhances PD detection through a combination of autoencoder (AE) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The proposed method analyzes the power spectral density (PSD) of preprocessed electroencephalography (EEG) signals, with artifacts removed, to assess energy distribution across EEG sub-bands. AEs are employed to extract features from reconstructed signals, which are subsequently classified by an RBFNN. The approach is validated on UC SanDiego's EEG dataset, consisting of 31 subjects and 93 minutes of recordings. The hybrid model demonstrates promising performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 99%. The improved accuracy is attributed to advanced feature selection techniques, robust data preprocessing, and the integration of AEs with RBFNN, setting a new benchmark in PD detection frameworks. This study highlights the efficacy of the hybrid deep learning framework in detecting PD, particularly emphasizing the importance of using multiple EEG channels and advanced preprocessing techniques. The results underscore the potential of this approach for practical clinical applications, offering a reliable solution for early and accurate PD detection.",1
39539459,P1 evoked by facial expression images is enhanced in Parkinson's disease patients with depressive symptoms.,"Depressive symptoms are most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is often overlooked due to absence of rapid and objective diagnostic biomarkers. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based event-related potentials (ERPs) is commonly used to assess emotional processes. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in ERPs in PD patients exhibiting depressive symptoms and to provide a reliable biomarker for assisting in the diagnosis of PD with depressive symptoms. We conducted a case-control study involving 30 PD patients with (dPD group) or without depressive symptoms (nPD group) and 13 age matched healthy controls (HC). We recorded EEG of the patients during the emotional picture stimulation task and analyzed the difference in the early ERPs potentials (P1, N170, early posterior negativity) and their correlation with the severity of symptoms in PD patients. Our results found that P1 amplitude in the occipital region of the dPD group in response to emotional faces was significantly higher than that of nPD and HC group, and it was positively correlated with severity of depressive symptoms in PD patients. Our study shows that facial expression-induced enhancement of P1 amplitude can be utilized as a rapid and objective indicator to screen for depressive symptoms in PD.",1
39526043,"Neurovascular unit, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration markers in brain disorders.","Neurovascular unit (NVU) inflammation via activation of glial cells and neuronal damage plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases. Though the exact mechanism of disease pathogenesis is not understood, certain biomarkers provide valuable insight into the disease pathogenesis, severity, progression and therapeutic efficacy. These markers can be used to assess pathophysiological status of brain cells including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, specialized microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, NVU, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Damage or derangements in tight junction (TJ), adherens junction (AdJ), and gap junction (GJ) components of the BBB lead to increased permeability and neuroinflammation in various brain disorders including neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, neuroinflammatory markers can be evaluated in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or brain tissues to determine neurological disease severity, progression, and therapeutic responsiveness. Chronic inflammation is common in age-related neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia. Neurotrauma/traumatic brain injury (TBI) also leads to acute and chronic neuroinflammatory responses. The expression of some markers may also be altered many years or even decades before the onset of neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we discuss markers of neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration associated with acute and chronic brain disorders, especially those associated with neurovascular pathologies. These biomarkers can be evaluated in CSF, or brain tissues. Neurofilament light (NfL), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119), aquaporin, endothelin-1, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) are some important neuroinflammatory markers. Recent BBB-on-a-chip modeling offers promising potential for providing an in-depth understanding of brain disorders and neurotherapeutics. Integration of these markers in clinical practice could potentially enhance early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and improve therapeutic outcomes.",1
39528881,An Automated Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease from MRI Scans Based on Enhanced Residual Dense Network with Attention Mechanism.,"The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has recently heightened interest in research on early diagnosis of these diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD), among the most prominent of these conditions, is a neurological disorder causing the loss of nerve cells and significantly affecting movement control. Detection of PD in early stages is of critical importance to prevent the progression of the disease and improve treatment processes. The aim of the current study is to develop a deep learning model that can perform accurate classification for early diagnosis of PD from MRI images. In this study, a densely connected feature fusion network with residual learning is designed to diagnose PD patients. The designed network consists of a serial dense block with skip connections and efficient attention mechanisms. In this architecture, squeeze-excitation (SE) blocks with ResNeXt (SE-ResNeXt block) modules are utilized to extract distinctive and high-level features. In the experiments, a publicly available T2-weighted MRI dataset is used, and an offline augmentation process is applied to limited data to increase the generalization ability and classification performance. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with current state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The obtained results show that the proposed model gives higher classification performance with an overall accuracy of 94.44%, precision of 91.67%, sensitivity of 91.67%, specificity of 95.83%, F1-score of 91.67%, and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 87.50% for the PD and healthy control subjects.",1
39528447,ASC specks as a single-molecule fluid biomarker of inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Immunotherapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease would be facilitated by better measures of inflammation. Here we established an ultra-sensitive single-molecule pull-down immunoassay combined with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to measure the number, size and shape of individual extracellular inflammasome ASC specks. We assayed human post-mortem brain, serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's as well as healthy elderly. The number of ASC specks increased and showed altered morphology in the blood of early-stage Parkinson's and Alzheimer's patients compared to controls, mimicking those found in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. In serum samples we also measured the number of Aβ, p-tau and α-syn aggregates and formed a composite biomarker of (ASC + p-tau)/Aβ and (ASC + α-syn)/Aβ ratios that distinguished age-matched healthy controls from patients with early-stage Alzheimer's with AUC of 92% and early-stage Parkinson's with AUC of 97%. Our findings confirm ASC specks as a fluid candidate biomarker of inflammation for neurodegenerative diseases with blood being the main focus for further development as convenient sample for diagnostics and clinical trials.",1
39523602,Mild behavioural impairment in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.,"Behavioural symptoms are common manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD). Early behavioural symptoms characterise mild behavioural impairment (MBI). The prevalence and intensity of MBI in people with PD (PwP) have been studied across various cohorts. However, methodological differences have obscured our understanding of MBI in these individuals. This systematic review examines and synthesises findings from relevant studies, enhancing understanding of the symptoms and implications of MBI in PD. Nine studies from five separate research institutions were identified. The conceptualisation of MBI varied considerably, affecting the reported prevalence rates of MBI in individuals with early-stage PD. Among PwP, MBI was associated higher education and impaired cognition. Affective dysregulation and impulse control disorders were primary contributors to MBI; abnormal perception was least contributor. This systematic review underscores the specific characteristics and incidence of MBI in early-stage PD. Mood and impulse control disorders are primary concerns associated with MBI. Future longitudinal studies are required to clarify the progression of these symptoms and evaluate MBI's potential as an indicator for PD-related dementia or increased dependency.",1
39522387,Development and validation of a machine learning-based diagnostic model for Parkinson's disease in community-dwelling populations: Evidence from the China health and retirement longitudinal study (CHARLS).,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder in Middle-aged and elderly people.There is a pressing need for effective predictive models, particularly in chinese population. This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based diagnostic model to identify individuals with PD in community-dwelling populations using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). We utilized data from 19,134 individuals aged 45 and above from the CHARLS dataset, with 265 adults reported to have PD. The external validation cohort included 1500 individuals, with 21 (1.4 %) having PD.The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to develop an interpretable PD prediction model, which was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation and externally validated with a dataset from Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values were employed to elucidate the model's predictions. The RF model demonstrated robust performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.884 and high sensitivity, specificity, and F1 scores. The model's performance in external validation cohort, highlighting an AUC of 0.82 and an accuracy of 0.99. The model's performance remained consistent across internal and external validation cohorts. SHAP analysis provided insights into the importance and interaction of various predictors, enhancing model interpretability. The study presents a highly accurate and interpretable machine learning-based diagnostic model to identify individuals with PD in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. By combined with predictive risk factors and chronic disease information, the model offers valuable insights for early identification and intervention, potentially mitigating PD progression.",1
39519043,Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease: A Contribution to Cognitive Impairment?,"Among the non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive impairment is one of the most common and disabling. It can occur either early or late during the disease, and it is heterogeneous in terms of its clinical manifestations, such as Subjective Cognitive Dysfunction (SCD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD). The aim of the present review is to delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in PD. This is extremely important to delineate the guidelines for the differential diagnosis and prognosis of the dysfunction, to identify the molecular and neuronal mechanisms involved, and to plan therapeutic strategies that can halt cognitive impairment progression. Specifically, the present review will discuss the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the progression of cognitive impairment in PD, with attention to mitochondria and their contribution to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal deterioration in the brain regions responsible for non-motor manifestations of the disease.",1
39513072,Does the Number of Turns during Sleep Have Utility in the Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease and Its Related Disorders?,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and its related disorders exhibit decreased sleep activity. However, the factors associated with this decreased sleep activity remain unknown. Thus, we aimed to explore the factors associated with sleep activity in patients with PD and its related disorders. This study included 33 patients with PD and its related disorders and 57 healthy participants who visited our outpatient clinics between November 2018 and March 2020. We evaluated the patients' muscle masses and measured the number of times they turned during sleep. The limb skeletal muscle index was utilized to evaluate the loss of muscle mass. This study was registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (Clinical Trials Registry number: UMIN000052436). Age, maximal grip strength, presarcopenia, phase angle (legs), history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, orthopedic diseases, and the number of turns during sleep were associated with PD and its related disorders. The number of turns was independently associated with PD and its related disorders. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the cutoff value for the number of turns was 6 (area under the curve, 0.986; sensitivity, 93.9%; specificity, 96.5%). The cutoff numbers of turns for men and women were 9 and 6, respectively (area under the curve, 1.0 and 0.981; sensitivity, 100% and 94.7%; specificity, 100% and 95.2%; respectively). The number of turns during sleep is significantly associated with PD and its related disorders and may decrease before patients present with sarcopenia. In addition, PD and its related disorders may coexist in men who turn less than nine times during sleep.",1
39509995,α-Synuclein plastic antibody applied to monitor monomeric structures and discriminate aggregated forms in human CSF.,"Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) occurs in presynaptic neurons and constitutes a key factor for the progression of Parkinson's disease, emphasising the urgency of early detection to support effective treatment. Unfortunately, a reliable, sensitive and cost-effective diagnostic tool has so far been lacking. Thus, this work presents a novel biosensor for detecting aSyn using plastic antibodies coupled to electrochemical detection. This biosensor was designed for portability and compatibility with point-of-care devices and exploits the electropolymerization of methylene blue (MB) together with aSyn on the carbon working electrode of screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). By electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the sensor showed exceptional analytical performance in detecting aSyn monomers in human CSF samples. It showed a linear trend of response from 1 fM to 10 pM with an impressively low limit of detection of 69 aM. Selectivity tests confirmed the predominant response to aSyn monomers, a less intense response to oligomers and insensitivity to fibrils. Overall, this plastic antibody-based electrochemical sensor represents a significant breakthrough as it is the first of its kind to accurately, sensitively and selectively detect aSyn monomers with a partial response to oligomers. Its simplicity and reproducibility promise to contribute to the early and effective diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.",1
39508600,Intersection of Sleep Disorders and Parkinson Disease: Unveiling the Bidirectional Relationship.,"Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) frequently exhibit non-motor symptoms, particularly sleep disturbances. Sleep disorders in PD patients are intricately linked to the pathogenesis and progression of PD itself, exacerbating neurodegenerative processes and worsening patient quality of life. This review underscores the significance of sleep disorders in PD, highlighting their prevalence, impact on disease progression, and the bidirectional relationship between sleep disruption and neurodegeneration. It aims to enhance clinician awareness for better diagnosis and management of sleep-related comorbidities in PD. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus using key terms such as ""sleep disorders"", ""Parkinson's disease"", ""REM sleep behavior disorder"", ""restless legs syndrome"", ""insomnia"", ""obstructive sleep apnea"", ""excessive daytime sleepiness"", ""circadian rhythm disorders"", ""sleep and neurodegeneration"". Sleep disorders are prevalent in PD affecting up to 90% of patients. Conditions such as insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and circadian rhythm disorders are commonly reported. These disorders are linked to multifactorial biological mechanisms and are associated with more severe disease phenotypes. Of note, several evidence shows that sleep abnormalities may contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, further accelerating the disease course. Sleep disturbances are critical non-motor symptoms in PD. Early diagnosis and tailored management of sleep disorders are essential for improving clinical outcomes and potentially offering neuroprotective benefits.",1
39500391,"Early α-synuclein/synapsin III co-accumulation, nigrostriatal dopaminergic synaptopathy and denervation in the MPTPp mouse model of Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and the presence of Lewy bodies (LB), intraneuronal inclusions mainly composed of α-synuclein (α-Syn) fibrils. Compelling evidence supports that, in PD brains, synapses are the sites where neurodegeneration initiates several years before the manifestation of motor symptoms. Furthermore, the amount of α-Syn deposited at synaptic terminals is several orders greater than that constituting LB. This hints that pathological synaptic α-Syn aggregates may be the main trigger for the retrograde synapse-to-cell body degeneration pattern characterizing early prodromal phases of PD. Identifying reliable biomarkers of synaptopathy is therefore crucial for early diagnosis. Here, we studied the alterations of key dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic striatal synaptic markers during the initial phases of axonal and cell body degeneration in mice subjected to 3 or 10 administrations of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine + probenecid (MPTPp), a model for early prodromal PD. We found that MPTPp administration resulted in progressive deposition of α-Syn, advancing from synaptic terminals to axons and dopaminergic neuron cell bodies. This was accompanied by marked co-accumulation of Synapsin III (Syn III), a synaptic protein previously identified as a component of α-Syn fibrils in post-mortem PD brains and as a main stabilizer of α-Syn aggregates, as well as very early and severe reduction of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in nigrostriatal neurons. Results also showed that striatal α-Syn accumulation and VMAT2 decrease, unlike other markers, did not recover following washout from 10 MPTPp administrations, supporting that these changes were precocious and severe. Finally, we found that early changes in striatal α-Syn, Syn III, VMAT2 and DAT observed following 3 MPTPp administrations, correlated with nigrostriatal neuron loss after 10 MPTPp administrations. These findings indicate that α-Syn/Syn III co-deposition characterizes very early stages of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in the MPTPp model and highlight that VMAT2 and Syn III could be two reliable molecular imaging biomarkers to predict dopamine neuron denervation and estimate α-Syn-related synaptopathy in prodromal and early symptomatic phases of PD.",1
39499184,Predicting Post-Mortem α-Synuclein Pathology by the Combined Presence of Probable REM sleep behavior disorder and Hyposmia.,"Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a strong known predictor of a final clinicopathological diagnosis of a Lewy type α-synucleinopathy (LTS). Olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom of synucleinopathies and has been repeatedly associated with the presence of post-mortem LTS. To assess the combined value of a clinician diagnosis of probable RBD (PRBD) and hyposmia in predicting the post-mortem presence of LTS in a broader, less-selected, volunteer elderly population. We studied 652 autopsied subjects from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders, which were evaluated for PRBD, had completed annual movement and cognitive assessments, and had at least one the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) olfactory test. Histological evidence of LTS was significantly more frequent in those who had PRBD (112/152: 73.7%) than those without (177/494: 35.8%) (P < 0.001). LTS was more frequent in cases with PRBD and a low UPSIT score (90.8%) compared to cases with PRBD only (73.7%) (P < 0.001) or cases with a low UPSIT score only (69.4%) (P < 0.001). Sensitivity of PRBD diagnosis for predicting LTS was 38.8% and specificity 88.8%, whereas sensitivity of a low UPSIT score was 74.4% and specificity 73.4% (Youden's index = 0.276 for PRBD, 0.478 for UPSIT). When combining both measures, sensitivity was 34.3% and specificity increased to 97.2%. PRBD, diagnosed without sleep study confirmation, combined with a reduced olfactory performance is highly specific for predicting post-mortem presence of LTS. The combination of both measures may provide a cost-effective means of predicting LTS in a broader community.",1

The management of PD including Pisa syndrome (PS), a postural deformity in PD characterized by reversible lateral bending of the trunk on the side, is often challenging. Recently, acupuncture has been a recognized intervention for treating motor or non-motor symptoms in PD management. However, very few of these studies or cases have been reported from Japan. A 58-year-old man with a four-year history of PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale: Stage 2) presented to the acupuncture department of our hospital with dysphasia, bradykinesia, forward posture, and newly appeared right-side bending of the trunk after he increased the dose of rotigotine delivered via skin patches six months earlier.

39496848,Parkinson disease therapy: current strategies and future research priorities.,"Parkinson disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurological disorder globally and poses substantial management challenges owing to progressive disability, emergence of levodopa-resistant symptoms, and treatment-related complications. In this Review, we examine the current state of research into PD therapies and outline future priorities for advancing our understanding and treatment of the disease. We identify two main research priorities for the coming years: first, slowing the progression of the disease through the integration of sensitive biomarkers and targeted biological therapies, and second, enhancing existing symptomatic treatments, encompassing surgical and infusion therapies, with the goal of postponing complications and improving long-term patient management. The path towards disease modification is impeded by the multifaceted pathophysiology and diverse mechanisms underlying PD. Ongoing studies are directed at α-synuclein aggregation, complemented by efforts to address specific pathways associated with the less common genetic forms of the disease. The success of these efforts relies on establishing robust end points, incorporating technology, and identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of disease progression. In the context of symptomatic treatment, the focus should shift towards refining existing approaches and fostering the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target levodopa-resistant symptoms and clinical manifestations that substantially impair quality of life.",1
39485864,Blood-Based Nanoparticle-Enhanced Quaking-Induced Conversion (Nano-QuIC): Inhibitor-Resistant Detection of Seeding Activity in Patients Diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.,"A hallmark of α-synucleinopathies (e.g., Parkinson's disease) is the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein in tissues and biological fluids. Protein amplification assays like real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) are sensitive yet currently limited to semi-invasive sample types such as cerebrospinal fluid because more accessible samples, such as blood, contain inhibitors. Here, we show that Nanoparticle-enhanced Quaking-induced Conversion (Nano-QuIC) can double the speed of reactions spiked with misfolded α-synuclein while increasing sensitivity 100-fold in human plasma. Nano-QuIC detected spike concentrations down to 90 pg/mL in lysed whole blood, while reactions without nanoparticles (RT-QuIC) failed to have any detection due to the presence of strong inhibitors. Moreover, Nano-QuIC showed increased seeding activity in plasma samples from Parkinson's patients (n = 4) versus healthy controls (n = 4). This sets the groundwork for the noninvasive diagnostic use of Nano-QuIC, potentially enabling early disease detection and management through blood-based testing.",1
39484776,"Diagnostic Potential of NEAT1, hsa-let-7a-5p, and miR-506-3p in Early-stage Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifaceted disease that is influenced by both genetic and environmental parameters. Non-coding RNAs have been shown to be ideal biomarkers for several diseases, including PD. This study was conducted to evaluate the expression levels of NEAT1, hsa-let-7a-5p, and miR-506-3p in individuals with PD to assess their efficacy for early-stage PD diagnosis. Twenty-four patients with PD and 29 healthy individuals participated in this study. The IntaRNA tool was used to predict potential base pairings between NEAT1 and let-7a-5p, and NEAT1 and miR-506-3p. RT-qPCR was employed to measure the relative expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), as well as nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), hsa-let-7a-5p, and miR-506-3p levels in both groups. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the diagnostic value. The PD group exhibited significantly elevated NEAT1 expression levels compared to the healthy control group. While the PD group exhibited an insignificant decreased TH expression level relative to the healthy group. Furthermore, the levels of hsa-let-7a-5p and miR-506-3p expression were seen to be decreased in patients with PD in comparison to the control group. Integration of NEAT1, hsa-let-7a-5p, and miR-506-3p levels significantly enhanced diagnostic capabilities and increased the AUC to 0.9501 (95% confidence interval: 0.8978-1.000, p < .0001). The elevated NEAT1 expression and the decreased expression of hsalet- 7a-5p and miR-506-3p in PD patients indicate that these factors might contribute to the disease's pathogenesis. Combining the ROC curves of NEAT1 and hsa-let-7a-5p with miR-506-3p showed improved sensitivity and specificity, facilitating more accurate PD diagnosis. More importantly, they may contribute as promising non-invasive biomarkers for PD diagnosis.",1
39482273,Skin Biopsy Detection of Phosphorylated α-Synuclein in Patients of Bullous Pemphigoid with or without Parkinson's Disease.,"High positivity rate of skin phosphorylated α-synuclein (P-SYN) was observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is one of the most common autoimmune skin diseases associated with PD. Our aim was to investigate whether BP patients might be a targeted risk population for the screening of skin P-SYN. Skin P-SYN expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in BP patients with/without PD. Twenty-two BP patients with PD, 24 BP patients without PD, and seven healthy donors were enrolled. Colocalization of P-SYN and PGP9.5 was found in all BP patients, but only one healthy control, whereas BP patients with PD showed higher expression than BP patients without PD (mean ± standard deviation, 10.7 ± 6.7 vs. 7.3 ± 3.2; P = 0.027). Positive expression was mainly observed in basement membrane zone and dermis. These results indicated BP patients might be a targeted risk population for the screening of skin P-SYN, which was helpful for the detection of PD early. © 2024 The Author(s).

39473150,Advances in Blood Biomarkers and Diagnosis Approaches for Neurodegenerative Dementias and Related Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative dementias and related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease have no fundamental cure yet. Degenerative proteins begin to accumulate before the onset of the symptoms of these diseases, and the early detection of these symptoms can lead to early therapeutic intervention. Therefore, early and simpler diagnostic methods are required. This review focuses on blood biomarkers, which are less expensive and easier to use than cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and diagnostic imaging. A variety of approaches exist for establishing diagnostic methods for neurodegenerative dementias using blood biomarkers, such as disease differentiation using a single molecule, methods that combine multiple biomarkers, studies that search for important markers by comprehensively analyzing many molecules, and methods that combine other data. Finally, we discuss the future prospects for blood biomarker research based on the characteristics of each approach.",1
39469072,Non-motor symptoms in patients with Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the  Genetically diagnosed (CAG repeats > 43) and symptomatic cases of SCA 12 were included in the study. Motor severity was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS). Non-motor symptoms such as depression, autonomic function, and cognition were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic Dysfunction (SCOPA-AUT), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. The mean age of the cohort with 34 SCA12 patients was 64.87 years (standard deviation 6.844). In this study, 21 patients (61.76%) had either mild or moderate cognitive impairment, almost equally frequent in early and advanced cases. Similarly a number of patients demonstrated evidence of moderate and severe depression. The SARA score was strongly associated with the MoCA score, and CAG repeat length could independently predict the MoCA score in this cohort. Autonomic symptoms were commonly present, with the majority of the patients experiencing urinary symptoms. Non-motor symptoms are common in SCA12 patients, even in the early stages of the condition. Timely detection and treatment of these symptoms may improve the therapeutic outcome and quality of life for SCA12 patients. The diverse symptoms of SCA12 perhaps indicate a widespread neurodegeneration beyond the cerebellum or its direct connections.",1
39467934,Association between serum IGF‑1 levels and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.,"We aimed to measure serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and assess their correlation with non-motor symptoms (NMS). Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal levels of IGF-1 play a crucial role in the development of PD. Further systematic research is needed to explore the potential roles of abnormal IGF-1 levels in NMS of PD. The study enrolled a total of 129 PD patients and 130 healthy controls (HCs). Within the PD cohort, 74 patients were classified as being in the early stage, while 55 were in the moderate stage. This study found no significant difference in serum IGF-1 levels between PD patients and HC. Further analysis revealed no significant difference in IGF-1 levels between early-stage PD and those in the moderate stages. Linear regression analysis indicated a significant association between serum IGF-1 levels and Nonmotor Symptom Scale (NMSS) scores in PD patients. Linear regression analysis revealed significant correlations between serum IGF-1 levels and general cognitive function, information processing speed, and executive function in PD patients. Furthermore, lower serum IGF-1 levels were associated with fatigue in PD patients. In summary, our study suggests a potential association between serum IGF-1 levels and specific NMS in patients with PD. These findings highlight the importance of long-term follow-up studies to determine whether serum biomarkers can serve as valuable tools for early detection of NMS in PD.",1
39465510,"Changes in serum uric acid, glutathione, and amyloid-β1-42 levels in Parkinson's disease patients and their association with disease progression and cognitive decline.","This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic significance of serum uric acid (UA), glutathione (GSH), and amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1-42) levels in relation to disease progression and cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 209 PD patients with disease duration ranging from 4.0 to 6.8 years were enrolled. Based on the Hoehn-Yahr staging system, patients were classified into Early ( Serum UA and GSH levels progressively declined with advancing disease stage, while Aβ1-42 increased. Compared to the NO-CD group, the CD group showed lower serum UA and GSH levels, and higher Aβ1-42 levels. Serum UA and GSH were inversely correlated with disease duration, levodopa equivalent daily dose, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, while Aβ1-42 showed positive correlations. UA ( Serum UA, GSH, and Aβ1-42 are independent predictors of disease progression and cognitive decline in PD patients. Their combined use offers enhanced diagnostic accuracy for disease staging and cognitive impairment in PD.",1
39465424,Large-fiber neuropathy in Parkinson's disease: a narrative review.,"Numerous studies reported a higher prevalence of polyneuropathy (PNP) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to the general population. Importantly, PNP symptoms can aggravate both motor and sensory disturbances in PD patients and negatively impact the disease course. Recent analyses indicate distinct PNP patterns in PD. This review aims to provide an overview of the current insights into etiological factors, diagnostic methods, and management strategies of large fiber neuropathy in PD. Despite the higher prevalence, the causes of PNP in PD are still not fully understood. A genetic predisposition can underlie PNP onset in PD. Main research attention is focused on long-term levodopa exposure which is suggested to increase PNP risk by depletion of methylation cofactors such as vitamin B12 and accumulation of homocysteine that altogether can alter peripheral nerve homeostasis. Beyond a potential ""iatrogenic"" cause, alpha-synuclein deposition has been detected in sural nerve fibers that could contribute to peripheral neuronal degeneration as part of the systemic manifestation of PD. Whereas mild axonal sensory PNP predominates in PD, a considerable proportion of patients also show motor and upper limb nerve involvement. Intriguingly, a correlation between PNP severity and PD severity has been demonstrated. Therefore, PNP screening involving clinical and instrument-based assessments should be implemented in the clinical routine for early detection and monitoring. Given the etiological uncertainty, therapeutic or preventive options remain limited. Vitamin supplementation and use of catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitors can be taken into consideration. PNP is increasingly recognized as a complicating comorbidity of PD patients. Long-term, large-scale prospective studies are required to elucidate the causative factors for the development and progression of PD-associated PNP to optimize treatment approaches. The overall systemic role of ""idiopathic"" PNP in PD and a putative association with the progression of neurodegeneration should also be investigated further.",1
39465276,Unveiling early signs of Parkinson's disease via a longitudinal analysis of celebrity speech recordings.,"Numerous studies proposed methods to detect Parkinson's disease (PD) via speech analysis. However, existing corpora often lack prodromal recordings, have small sample sizes, and lack longitudinal data. Speech samples from celebrities who publicly disclosed their PD diagnosis provide longitudinal data, allowing the creation of a new corpus, ParkCeleb. We collected videos from 40 subjects with PD and 40 controls and analyzed evolving speech features from 10 years before to 20 years after diagnosis. Our longitudinal analysis, focused on 15 subjects with PD and 15 controls, revealed features like pitch variability, pause duration, speech rate, and syllable duration, indicating PD progression. Early dysarthria patterns were detectable in the prodromal phase, with the best classifiers achieving AUCs of 0.72 and 0.75 for data collected ten and five years before diagnosis, respectively, and 0.93 post-diagnosis. This study highlights the potential for early detection methods, aiding treatment response identification and screening in clinical trials.",1
39461569,Diagnostic and mechanistic roles of MicroRNAs in neurodevelopmental & neurodegenerative disorders.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as crucial elements in the regulation of gene expression, playing a significant role in the underlying neurobiology of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders. This review examines the intricate involvement of miRNAs in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome (TS), schizophrenia (SCZ), and mood disorders. This review highlights how miRNA dysregulation can illuminate the molecular pathways of these diseases and potentially serve as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, miRNAs' ability to target genes critical to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of trinucleotide repeat and neurodevelopmental disorders, and their distinctive patterns in SCZ and mood disorders are discussed. The review also stresses the value of miRNAs in precision neuropsychiatry, where they could predict treatment outcomes and aid in disease management. Furthermore, the study of conserved miRNAs in model organisms like Drosophila underscores their broad utility and provides deeper mechanistic insights into their biological functions. This comprehensive examination of miRNAs across various conditions advocates for their integration into clinical practice, promising advancements in personalized healthcare for neurological and psychiatric conditions.",1
39456949,Brain-Region-Specific Differences in Protein Citrullination/Deimination in a Pre-Motor Parkinson's Disease Rat Model.,"The detection of early molecular mechanisms and potential biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a challenge. Recent research has pointed to novel roles for post-translational citrullination/deimination caused by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), a family of calcium-activated enzymes, in the early stages of the disease. The current study assessed brain-region-specific citrullinated protein targets and their associated protein-protein interaction networks alongside PAD isozymes in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced rat model of pre-motor PD. Six brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, cerebellum and olfactory bulb) were compared between controls/shams and the pre-motor PD model. For all brain regions, there was a significant difference in citrullinated protein IDs between the PD model and the controls. Citrullinated protein hits were most abundant in cortex and hippocampus, followed by cerebellum, midbrain, olfactory bulb and striatum. Citrullinome-associated pathway enrichment analysis showed correspondingly considerable differences between the six brain regions; some were overlapping for controls and PD, some were identified for the PD model only, and some were identified in control brains only. The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways identified in PD brains only were associated with neurological, metabolic, immune and hormonal functions and included the following: ""Axon guidance""; ""Spinocerebellar ataxia""; ""Hippo signalling pathway""; ""NOD-like receptor signalling pathway""; ""Phosphatidylinositol signalling system""; ""Rap1 signalling pathway""; ""Platelet activation""; ""Yersinia infection""; ""Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis""; ""Human cytomegalovirus infection""; ""Inositol phosphate metabolism""; ""Thyroid hormone signalling pathway""; ""Progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation""; ""Oocyte meiosis""; and ""Choline metabolism in cancer"". Some brain-region-specific differences were furthermore observed for the five PAD isozymes (PADs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6), with most changes in PAD 2, 3 and 4 when comparing control and PD brain regions. Our findings indicate that PAD-mediated protein citrullination plays roles in metabolic, immune, cell signalling and neurodegenerative disease-related pathways across brain regions in early pre-motor stages of PD, highlighting PADs as targets for future therapeutic avenues.",1
39445342,Smartphone automated motor and speech analysis for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease: Validation of TapTalk across 20 different devices.,"Smartphones are proving useful in assessing movement and speech function in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Valid outcomes across different smartphones are needed before population-level tests are deployed. This study introduces the TapTalk protocol, a novel app designed to capture hand and speech function and validate it in smartphones against gold-standard measures. Twenty different smartphones collected video data from motor tests and audio data from speech tests. Features were extracted using Google Mediapipe (movement) and Python audio analysis packages (speech). Electromagnetic sensors (60 Hz) and a microphone acquired simultaneous movement and voice data, respectively. TapTalk video and audio outcomes were comparable to gold-standard data: 90.3% of video, and 98.3% of audio, data recorded tapping/speech frequencies within ± 1 Hz of the gold-standard measures. Validation of TapTalk across a range of devices is an important step in the development of smartphone-based telemedicine and was achieved in this study.

40130281,The Role of Glial Cell Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Glial cell senescence, characterized by the irreversible arrest of cell division and a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, has emerged as a critical player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (ad). While much attention has been devoted to the role of neurons in ad, growing evidence suggests that glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, contribute significantly to disease progression through senescence. In this review, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying glial cell senescence in ad, focusing on the cellular signaling pathways, including DNA damage response and the accumulation of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP). We also examine how senescent glial cells exacerbate neuroinflammation, disrupt synaptic function, and promote neuronal death in ad. Moreover, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting glial cell senescence to mitigate the neurodegenerative processes in ad. By providing a comprehensive overview of current research on glial cell senescence in Alzheimer's disease, this review highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic target in the fight against ad.",0
40130194,Voluntary locomotion induces an early and remote hemodynamic decrease in the large cerebral veins.,"Behavior regulates dural and cerebral vessels, with spontaneous locomotion inducing dural vessel constriction and increasing stimulus-evoked cerebral hemodynamic responses. It is vital to investigate the function of different vascular network components, surrounding and within the brain, to better understand the role of the neurovascular unit in health and neurodegeneration. We characterized locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses across vascular compartments of the whisker barrel cortex: artery, vein, parenchyma, draining, and meningeal vein. Using 2D-OIS, hemodynamic responses during locomotion were recorded in 9- to 12-month-old awake mice: wild-type, Alzheimer's disease (AD), atherosclerosis, or mixed (atherosclerosis/AD) models. Within the somatosensory cortex, responses were taken from pial vessels inside the whisker barrel region [(WBR): ""whisker artery"" and ""whisker vein""], a large vein from the sagittal sinus adjacent to the WBR (draining vein), and meningeal vessels from the dura mater (which do not penetrate cortical tissue). We demonstrate that locomotion evokes an initial decrease in total hemoglobin (HbT) within the draining vein before the increase in HbT within WBR vessels. The locomotion event size influences the magnitude of the HbT increase in the pial vessels of the WBR but not of the early HbT decrease within the draining veins. Following locomotion onset, an early HbT decrease was also observed in the overlying meningeal vessels, which unlike within the cortex did not go on to exceed baseline HbT levels during the remainder of the locomotion response. We show that locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses are altered in disease in the draining vein and whisker artery, suggesting this could be an important neurodegeneration biomarker. This initial reduction in HbT within the draining and meningeal veins potentially serves as a ""space-saving"" mechanism, allowing for large increases in cortical HbT associated with locomotion. Given this mechanism is impacted by disease, it may provide an important target for vascular-based therapeutic interventions.",0
40130187,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Ofatumumab versus Teriflunomide for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: A 10-Year Markov Model.,"Ofatumumab, a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is a promising disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). This study investigates its cost-effectiveness compared to teriflunomide from the perspective of Saudi healthcare payers. This comparison is crucial for informing treatment strategies and resource allocation in Saudi Arabia, where RRMS poses a significant healthcare burden and access to newer DMTs is evolving. A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of ofatumumab compared to teriflunomide for treating RRMS in Saudi Arabia. This model simulates disease progression over 10 years, a timeframe chosen for its clinical relevance and consistency with similar studies. To reflect the Saudi patient population, the model uses a hypothetical cohort with characteristics mirroring those in the ASCLEPIOS I/II clinical trials. The model incorporates transition probabilities between disease states, primarily derived from the British Columbia MS (BCMS) database and further refined using data from the ASCLEPIOS trials. To ensure relevance to the Saudi context, local data sources were utilized, including drug costs from the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) and health state costs from published local studies. Clinical expert input was incorporated to validate model assumptions.The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the model findings. Compared to teriflunomide, ofatumumab yielded incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $46,188 per QALY over the 10-year period. Ofatumumab demonstrated a greater impact on reducing disability progression, particularly in the early stages of the disease. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $99,120 per QALY, ofatumumab demonstrated a 99.14% probability of cost-effectiveness in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that ofatumumab is a cost-effective treatment for RRMS in Saudi Arabia, with an ICER below the WTP. Policymakers should consider including ofatumumab in national formularies and prioritize its use in early-stage RRMS to maximize patient benefit and cost-effectiveness.",0
40129881,"Betaine alleviates deficits in motor behavior, neurotoxic effects, and neuroinflammatory responses in a rat model of demyelination.","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized as a chronic inflammatory demyelinating neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the deterioration of the myelin sheath and the loss of axons. Betaine, a trimethylglycine compound, is recognized for its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and exhibits properties that are antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective. The cuprizone (CPZ) model serves as an effective tool for investigating the processes of demyelination and remyelination associated with MS. In our research, we examined the protective and therapeutic effects of betaine in a rat model of MS induced by CPZ. The experimental protocol involved administering 600 mg/kg of CPZ orally for 7 days, followed by 2 weeks with 200 mg/kg of CPZ. The protective group received a combination of betaine (1 g/kg/day, orally) and CPZ (200 mg/kg/day), while the therapeutic group was treated with CPZ (600 mg/kg) alongside betaine for three weeks. Behavioral assessments were conducted using inverted screen and rotarod tests to measure balance, motor coordination, and grasping ability. Following these evaluations, the rats were euthanized for analysis of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers, toluidine blue staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, and myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining of the corpus callosum (CC). The results indicated that betaine significantly enhanced balance, motor coordination, and grasping ability, while decreasing oxidative stress, inhibiting interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17 levels, and reversing the demyelination caused by CPZ. Notably, betaine also mitigated the increase in homocysteine (Hcy) levels and facilitated remyelination, evidenced by the presence of normal compacted myelin and increased expression of MBP in the CC. This study substantiates the remyelinating effects of betaine in the context of CPZ-induced demyelination. It suggests that it may contribute to the repair of myelin through the modulation of behavioral deficits, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, ultrastructural changes, and MBP expression levels, indicating its potential as a complementary therapeutic agent in the management of MS.",0
40129751,"A mindfulness-based multicomponent caregiver intervention (PAACC): objectives, study design, and cohort description.","Effective interventions are needed to reduce caregiver burden and stress, particularly among family caregivers of veterans with dementia. Unique risk factors such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) further complicate caregiving. This study compares a four-session mindfulness-based multicomponent intervention (PAACC) with a cognitive behavioral intervention (REACH), both designed to alleviate caregiver burden, and provides a baseline evaluation of caregivers in the intervention. A two-arm, blinded, randomized controlled trial assigned 133 dementia caregivers to PAACC ( The study utilized a two-arm, blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial to compare the PAACC and REACH interventions. A total of 133 dementia caregivers experiencing moderate to severe caregiver burden were assigned to receive either the PAACC intervention ( Baseline assessments were conducted on 133 family caregivers of veterans living with dementia. The average caregiver age was 67.17 years (SD = 9.8), 85% were women, and 70% were spousal caregivers. No significant demographic differences were found between the two intervention groups. However, baseline comparisons showed that caregivers in the PAACC intervention reported higher depressive symptoms and anxiety, and lower mindfulness receptivity. A detailed protocol for the mindfulness-based multicomponent caregiver intervention PAACC is described. There is a growing need for multicomponent, skill-building interventions tailored for dementia caregivers who are at high risk of stress. This study introduces the first mindfulness-based intervention specifically for caregivers of veterans, designed to enhance cognitive flexibility, cultivate compassion, and equip caregivers with practical skills to improve their quality of life. PAACC is a mindfulness-based multicomponent intervention for dementia caregivers of veterans.No demographic differences suggest psychological differences are not due to demographics.Baseline mental health and mindfulness readiness may impact intervention effectiveness.",0
40129664,"Ketogenic diet, adenosine, and dopamine in addiction and psychiatry.","Adhering to the ketogenic diet can reduce or stop seizures, even when other treatments fail, via mechanism(s) distinct from other available therapies. These results have led to interest in the diet for treating conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, depression and schizophrenia. Evidence points to the neuromodulator adenosine as a key mechanism underlying therapeutic benefits of a ketogenic diet. Adenosine represents a unique and direct link among cell energy, neuronal activity, and gene expression, and adenosine receptors form functional heteromers with dopamine receptors. The importance of the dopaminergic system is established in addiction, as are the challenges of modulating the dopamine system directly. A mediator that could antagonize dopamine's effects would be useful, and adenosine is such a mediator due to its function and location. Studies report that the ketogenic diet improves cognition, sociability, and perseverative behaviors, and might improve depression. Many of the translational opportunities based on the ketogenic diet/adenosine link have come to the fore, including addiction, autism spectrum disorder, painful conditions, and a range of hyperdopaminergic disorders.",0
40129526,Trends in mortality due to ischemic heart diseases among patients with Alzheimer's disease in the United States from 1999 to 2020.,"Ischemic heart diseases (IHD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) significantly contribute to mortality in aging population. Understanding mortality trends where these conditions overlap is crucial for developing targeted interventions for vulnerable populations. We analyzed CDC WONDER mortality data from 1999 to 2020 for individuals aged ≥45 years. IHD and AD mortality were identified using ICD-10 codes I20-I25 and G30, respectively. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) per 100,000 were calculated, and trends were analyzed by gender, race, region, place of death and state. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate annual percentage changes (APC) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). A total of 171,080 deaths were attributed to IHD in individuals with AD from 1999 to 2020. The AAMR decreased from 10.6 in 1999 to 4.1 in 2020, with a significant decline between 2004 and 2014 (APC: -7.73; 95 % CI: -8.42 to -7.24). Females exhibited higher overall AAMR compared to males (Females: 6.8 vs. Males: 6.4). Individuals of Non-Hispanic (NH) White ancestry had the highest AAMR (6.8), followed by those of NH Black (6.5) and Hispanic ancestry (5.9). The West region reported the highest AAMR at 7.9, while the Midwest had the lowest at 6.3. Oklahoma recorded the highest state-level AAMR (10.9), while Utah had the lowest (3.2). IHD mortality in individuals with AD declined significantly, with disparities by gender, race, and geography. These findings underscore the need for tailored public health approaches to address the evolving burden of IHD in AD patients.",0
40129418,Life-long music and dance relationships and therapeutic impressions in individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment to inform the design of music- and dance-based therapies.,"BackgroundNo effective therapies exist to prevent neurodegenerative mild cognitive impairment (MCI) related to Alzheimer's disease. Therapies integrating music and/or dance are promising non-pharmacological options to effectively mitigate cognitive decline.ObjectiveTo deepen our understanding of individuals' relationships (i.e., histories, experiences, and attitudes) with music and dance, in order to incorporate such knowledge into the design of music- and dance-based interventions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes.MethodsEleven older adults with MCI and five of their care partners/ spouses (4 M/12F; Black: n = 4, White: n = 10, Hispanic/Latino: n = 2; Age: 71.4 ± 9.6 years) first completed questionnaires, then participated in focus groups that captured aspects of their relationships with music and dance. Emergent themes were extracted from four major topics, including: (1) experience and history, (2) enjoyment and preferences, (3) confidence and barriers, and (4) impressions of music and dance as therapeutic tools.ResultsThematic analysis revealed participants' positive impressions of music and dance as potential therapeutic interventions, citing perceived neuropsychological, emotional, and physical benefits. Participants viewed music and dance as integral to their lives, histories, and identities within a culture, family, and/ or community. Participants also identified lifelong engagement barriers that, in conjunction with negative feedback, instilled persistent low self-efficacy regarding dancing and active music engagement. Questionnaires verified individuals' moderately-strong music and dance relationships, which were strongest in passive forms of music engagement (e.g., listening).ConclusionsOur findings support that individuals' music and dance relationships and the associated perceptions toward music and dance therapy may offer valuable insights that enhance the design of efficacious and engaging non-pharmacological therapies for individuals with MCI.",0

Given its time and personnel burden, there is a need to more efficiently identify patients who warrant further evaluation or clinical trial qualification. To potentially address this need, a novel performance-based test of cognition and daily functioning has been developed for use in AD research and clinical care.ObjectiveTo test whether this novel performance-based test is associated with levels of daily functioning in both impaired and unimpaired individuals.MethodsOne-hundred-seventy-one participants (72 cognitively unimpaired; 53 amnestic mild cognitive impairment; 46 mild AD) completed the novel performance-based test of cognition and daily functioning, as well as the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) for estimating global CDR.ResultsThe novel test was significantly associated with the QDRS Total, as well as the Behavioral and Cognitive subdomains, and differentiated between estimated global CDR scores of 0 versus ≥0.5.

40129186,Simultaneous Monitoring of Tyrosinase and ATP in Thick Brain Tissues Using a Single Two-Photon Fluorescent Probe.,"Cellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism in the central nervous system are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, their real-time and concurrent monitoring in thick tissues remains challenging. Herein, a single dual-emission two-photon fluorescent probe (named DST) is designed for the simultaneous tracking of tyrosinase (TYR) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), thereby enabling the real-time monitoring of both neurocellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism in brain tissue. The developed DST probe exhibits excellent sensitivity and selectivity toward TYR and ATP, with distinctive responses in the blue and red fluorescence channels being observed without spectra crosstalk. Using this probe, the correlation and regulatory mechanism between TYR and ATP during oxidative stress are uncovered. Additionally, the two-photon nature of this probe allows alterations in the TYR and ATP levels to be monitored across different brain regions in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Notably, a significant decrease in ATP levels is revealed within the somatosensory cortex (S1BF) and caudate putamen brain regions of an AD mouse, alongside an increase in TYR levels within the S1BF and laterodorsal thalamic nucleus brain regions. These findings indicate the potential of applying the spatially resolved regulation of neurocellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism to treat neurodegenerative diseases.",0
40129145,Deciphering T Cell Dynamics in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis: Insights and Implications.,"Neuroinflammation has emerged as a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), paving the way for promising therapeutic interventions. Increasing evidence highlights the interplay between the peripheral immune system and the central nervous system (CNS) in driving neuroinflammation, with T lymphocytes playing a vital role in both regulatory and effector functions. Aberrant activation of T cells during the early stages of neuroinflammation perpetuates inflammatory responses by interacting with CNS glial cells and releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17. Studies have documented significant T cell activation and infiltration into the brain parenchyma in AD, contributing to disease progression. However, the specific mechanisms by which T cells mediate AD pathogenesis remain unclear. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current understanding of T cell involvement in AD pathology, emphasizing their aberrant activation, interactions with microglia, tau protein pathology, and the influence of gut microbiota. Finally, we propose potential treatment modalities for AD, highlighting the promise of T cellbased therapies currently under investigation in clinical trials. Understanding the critical role of T cells in intercellular communication and disease progression may enhance our comprehension of the pathophysiology of AD.",0

40128806,High-dimensional mediation analysis reveals the mediating role of physical activity patterns in genetic pathways leading to AD-like brain atrophy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder that affects multiple biological systems including cognition, behavior and physical health. Unfortunately, the pathogenic mechanisms behind AD are not yet clear and the treatment options are still limited. Despite the increasing number of studies examining the pairwise relationships between genetic factors, physical activity (PA), and AD, few have successfully integrated all three domains of data, which may help reveal mechanisms and impact of these genomic and phenomic factors on AD. We use high-dimensional mediation analysis as an integrative framework to study the relationships among genetic factors, PA and AD-like brain atrophy quantified by spatial patterns of brain atrophy. We integrate data from genetics, PA and neuroimaging measures collected from 13,425 UK Biobank samples to unveil the complex relationship among genetic risk factors, behavior and brain signatures in the contexts of aging and AD. Specifically, we used a composite imaging marker, Spatial Pattern of Abnormality for Recognition of Early AD (SPARE-AD) that characterizes AD-like brain atrophy, as an outcome variable to represent AD risk. Through GWAS, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with SPARE-AD as exposure variables. We employed conventional summary statistics and functional principal component analysis to extract patterns of PA as mediators. After constructing these variables, we utilized a high-dimensional mediation analysis method, Bayesian Mediation Analysis (BAMA), to estimate potential mediating pathways between SNPs, multivariate PA signatures and SPARE-AD. BAMA incorporates Bayesian continuous shrinkage prior to select the active mediators from a large pool of candidates. We identified a total of 22 mediation pathways, indicating how genetic variants can influence SPARE-AD by altering physical activity. By comparing the results with those obtained using univariate mediation analysis, we demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional mediation analysis methods over univariate mediation analysis. Through integrative analysis of multi-omics data, we identified several mediation pathways of physical activity between genetic factors and SPARE-AD. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Moreover, our research demonstrates the potential of the high-dimensional mediation analysis method in revealing the mechanisms of disease.",0
40128675,Modifiable dementia risk factors in Chilean adults are distinctively associated with social determinants of health. Cross-sectional study.,"In Latin America, dementia cases will double by 2050. For effective prevention in this region, it is crucial to comprehend the distribution of dementia risk factors within the local population and to assess their association with social determinants of health (SDH). Our objective was to explore the association between different modifiable dementia risk factors within the Chilean population in a cross-sectional study. 3379 dementia-free subjects ≥ 45 years old from the 2016-2017 Chilean National Health Survey were analyzed and stratified into four groups by sex and age, searching for clusters using six continuous variables that had been related to dementia risk (years of education, systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), units of alcohol consumption, physical activity, and depressive symptoms). Three clusters of individuals shared similar risk factors in each sex/age group. A cluster with high cardiometabolic risk was present in all sex/age groups, characterized by high systolic blood pressure (HSBP) in men midlife and by HSBP associated with high BMI (HSBP/HBMI) in women and in men later-life. A depressive cluster and a physically inactive cluster were present in 3⁄4 of the sex/age groups. Additionally, there was a cluster that was relatively healthy but had a risk of excessive alcohol consumption in men later-life and a low risk one in women midlife. The HSBP/HBMI and depressive clusters presented a high proportion of multiple dementia risk factors. Lower levels of education (and lower family income) were associated with the HSBP and HSBP/HBMI cluster; in contrast, higher levels of education were associated with clusters with lower risk. In Chile, subpopulations with more disadvantages SDH have a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors. Subpopulations with depression and those with high cardiometabolic risk have a higher accumulation of dementia risk factors. These results highlight that tailored programs improving healthcare accessibility for those with more disadvantages SDH and multidisciplinary interventions for high-risk populations are needed for effective dementia prevention.",0

Baseline characteristics on structural MRI, such as size, enhancement proportion and eloquent brain involvement inform grading and treatment planning. Currently, free-text imaging reports depend on the individual style and experience of the radiologist. Standardisation may increase consistency of feature reporting. We compared 100 baseline free-text reports for glioma MRI scans with a structured feature list based on VASARI criteria and performed a full second read to document which VASARI features were in the baseline report. We found that quantitative features including tumour size and proportion of necrosis and oedema/infiltration were commonly not included in free-text reports. Thirty-three percent of reports gave a description of size only, and 38% of reports did not refer to tumour size at all. Detailed information about tumour location including involvement of eloquent areas and infiltration of deep white matter was also missing from the majority of free-text reports. Overall, we graded 6% of reports as having omitted some key VASARI features that would alter patient management. Tumour size and anatomical information is often omitted by neuroradiologists. Comparison with a structured report identified key features that would benefit from standardisation and/or quantification. Structured reporting may improve glioma reporting consistency, clinical communication, and treatment decisions.",0
40128538,Caregiver burden of Alzheimer's disease among informal caregivers: a cross-sectional study in Malaysia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) not only impacts the patients but substantially informal caregivers in terms of physical and psychological burden. This study aims to determine the burden level of informal caregivers of patients with different stages of AD and use of special accommodation (SpA) along with its predictors. A cross-sectional study was conducted by interviewing AD patients and informal caregivers recruited from 4 tertiary hospitals. Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) was used to estimate caregivers' burden. The analysis categorized informal caregivers of AD patients into two groups based on the use of SpA. Multivariable linear regression was employed to identify potential determinants of subjective caregiver burden. As a result, caregivers' burden experienced by informal caregivers of severe community-dwelling AD patients was significantly higher (p = 0.024) than those with special accommodation. As AD advanced, caregivers' burden was elevated significantly (p = 0.021) from mild to severe AD among community-dwelling patients. In multivariable analysis, severe AD (standardised β = 0.187, p = 0.047 vs. mild AD) and spousal relationship (standardised β = 0.241, p = 0.026 vs. other relationships) were found to be significant factors in predicting caregivers' burden. Hence, the physical and social needs of informal caregivers must not be overlooked. Severe AD significantly increased caregiver burden in community dwelling patients. Spousal caregivers report a higher perceived burden compared to caregivers with other relationships. Policymakers need to recognize and address the substantial demands placed on informal caregivers by providing essential social support. Special accommodation could alleviate the burden on informal caregivers, particularly those caring for patients with severe AD.",0
40128515,GALM Alleviates Aβ Pathology and Cognitive Deficit Through Increasing ADAM10 Maturation in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, causing dementia and affecting millions of individuals. One prominent characteristic in the brains of AD patients is glucose hypometabolism. In the context of galactose metabolism, intracellular glucose levels are heightened. Galactose mutarotase (GALM) plays a crucial role in maintaining normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of β-D-galactose into α-D-galactose (α-D-G). The latter is then converted into glucose-6-phosphate, improving glucose metabolism levels. However, the involvement of GALM in AD progression is still unclear. In the present study, we found that the expression of GALM was significantly increased in AD patients and model mice. Genetic knockdown of GALM using adeno-associated virus did not change the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP-cleaving enzymes including a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1). Interestingly, genetic overexpression of GALM reduced APP and Aβ deposition by increasing the maturation of ADAM10, although it did not alter the expression of BACE1 and PS1. Further electrophysiological and behavioral experiments showed that GALM overexpression significantly ameliorated the deficits in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning and memory in AD model mice. Importantly, direct α-D-G (20 mg/kg, i.p.) also inhibited Aβ deposition by increasing the maturation of ADAM10, thereby improving hippocampal CA1 LTP and spatial learning and memory in AD model mice. Taken together, our results indicate that GALM shifts APP processing towards α-cleavage, preventing Aβ generation by increasing the level of mature ADAM10. These findings indicate that GALM may be a potential therapeutic target for AD, and α-D-G has the potential to be used as a dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of AD.",0
40128501,Death in advance or people living with dementia? Extending the philosophical discourse of Schweda and Jongsma through the persistence of self and other strengths.,"This article presents an extension of an article previously featured in History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences by Schweda and Jongsma (History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences, 2022), who aptly (1) critiqued the ""Zombification"" of people living with dementia by reviewing the historic and philosophic origins of this damaging metaphor and (2) offered a life course perspective to highlight the ethical implications related to biomedicine and the life sciences. Herein, we aim to build upon and constructively critique the important discourse offered by Schweda and Jongsma by (1) presenting a transdisciplinary perspective highlighting many important remaining social and cognitive abilities of people living with dementia that (2) further informs philosophical discussion and (3) provides ways of helping people diagnosed as well as formal and informal caregivers to live with dementia rather than enduring the damaging and incorrect ""living death"" notion, and its ramifications, of the syndrome. In the process, we will explore many inherent harms associated with the ""zombie-like"" construction of the syndrome: harms that entail dysfunctional treatment of people living with dementia. Specifically, we will draw upon evidence from psychology, sociology, philosophy, neurology, and neuroscience, to provide an integrated, whole-person perspective that adds specific dimensions to the life-course perspective and support the necessary multifaceted interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and clinical collaborations for this complex issue.",0
40128483,Adolescent Alcohol and the Spectrum of Cognitive Dysfunction in Aging.,"Among the many changes associated with aging, inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and throughout the body likely contributes to the constellation of health-related maladies associated with aging. Genetics, lifestyle factors, and environmental experiences shape the trajectory of aging-associated inflammation, including the developmental timing, frequency, and intensity of alcohol consumption. This chapter posits that neuroinflammatory processes form a critical link between alcohol exposure and the trajectory of healthy aging, at least in part through direct or indirect interactions with cholinergic circuits that are crucial to cognitive integrity. In this chapter, we begin with a discussion of how inflammation changes from early development through late aging; discuss the role of inflammation and alcohol in the emergence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI); elaborate on critical findings on the contribution of alcohol-related thiamine deficiency to the loss of cholinergic function and subsequent development of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS); and present emerging findings at the intersection of alcohol and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). In doing so, our analysis points toward inflammation-mediated compromise of basal forebrain cholinergic function as a key culprit in cognitive dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol exposure, effects that may be rescuable through either pharmacological or behavioral approaches. Furthermore, our chapter reveals an interesting dichotomy in the effects of alcohol on neuropathological markers of ADRD that depend upon both biological sex and genetic vulnerability.",0
40128482,Recent Investigations Designed to Unravel the Interaction of Age and Alcohol on Behavior and Cognition: Potential Neurobiological Mechanisms.,"Understanding factors that alter the effect of alcohol in biological systems has been an area of active investigation for several decades. Recently, it has become clear that age is one of the most salient factors influencing how both acute and chronic alcohol exposure alters behavioral function. The following book chapter discusses how alcohol produces differential effects in adolescent animals in comparison to adult and aged (i.e., older) animals. Furthermore, where possible, relevant research identifying possible brain mechanisms mediating the differential effects of alcohol will be discussed. Finally, we highlight a small number of studies where sex and age of the subject interact to modify cognitive impairments produced by alcohol. We conclude that much work still needs to be done to fully understand how age, sex, and alcohol interact to produce the wide range of effects caused by consumption of the drug.",0
40128481,Excessive Alcohol Use as a Risk Factor for Alzheimer's Disease: Epidemiological and Preclinical Evidence.,"Alcohol use has recently emerged as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which alcohol interacts with AD pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this chapter, we review the epidemiological and preclinical support for the interaction between alcohol use and AD. We hypothesize that alcohol use increases the rate of accumulation of specific AD-relevant pathologies during the prodromal phase and exacerbates dementia onset and progression. We find that alcohol consumption rates are increasing in adolescence, middle age, and aging populations. In tandem, rates of AD are also on the rise, potentially as a result of this increased alcohol use throughout the lifespan. We then review the biological processes in common between alcohol use disorder and AD as a means to uncover potential mechanisms by which they interact; these include oxidative stress, neuroimmune function, metabolism, pathogenic tauopathy development and spread, and neuronal excitatory/inhibitory balance (EIB). Finally, we provide some forward-thinking suggestions we believe this field should consider. In particular, the inclusion of alcohol use assessments in longitudinal studies of AD and more preclinical studies on alcohol's impacts using better animal models of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).",0
40128391,Integrating multimodal data to understand cortical circuit architecture and function.,"In recent years there has been a tremendous growth in new technologies that allow large-scale investigation of different characteristics of the nervous system at an unprecedented level of detail. There is a growing trend to use combinations of these new techniques to determine direct links between different modalities. In this Perspective, we focus on the mouse visual cortex, as this is one of the model systems in which much progress has been made in the integration of multimodal data to advance understanding. We review several approaches that allow integration of data regarding various properties of cortical cell types, connectivity at the level of brain areas, cell types and individual cells, and functional neural activity in vivo. The increasingly crucial contributions of computation and theory in analyzing and systematically modeling data are also highlighted. Together with open sharing of data, tools and models, integrative approaches are essential tools in modern neuroscience for improving our understanding of the brain architecture, mechanisms and function.",0
40128350,Knowing the enemy: strategic targeting of complement to treat Alzheimer disease.,"The complement system protects against infection, positively responds to tissue damage, clears cell debris, directs and modulates the adaptive immune system, and functions in neuronal development, normal synapse elimination and intracellular metabolism. However, complement also has a role in aberrant synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation - processes that lead to a feedforward loop of inflammation, injury and neuronal death that can contribute to neurodegenerative and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer disease. This Review provides justification, largely from preclinical mouse models but also from correlates with human tissue and biomarkers, for targeting specific complement components for therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer disease. We discuss promising strategies to slow the progression of cognitive loss with minimal undesired effects. The diverse interactions and functions of complement system components can influence biological processes in the healthy and diseased brain; here, these functions are described as a prerequisite to selecting appropriate, safe and effective therapeutic targets for translation to the clinic.",0
40128348,Optimal dietary patterns for healthy aging.,"As the global population ages, it is critical to identify diets that, beyond preventing noncommunicable diseases, optimally promote healthy aging. Here, using longitudinal questionnaire data from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2016) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2016), we examined the association of long-term adherence to eight dietary patterns and ultraprocessed food consumption with healthy aging, as assessed according to measures of cognitive, physical and mental health, as well as living to 70 years of age free of chronic diseases. After up to 30 years of follow-up, 9,771 (9.3%) of 105,015 participants (66% women, mean age = 53 years (s.d. = 8)) achieved healthy aging. For each dietary pattern, higher adherence was associated with greater odds of healthy aging and its domains. The odds ratios for the highest quintile versus the lowest ranged from 1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-1.57; healthful plant-based diet) to 1.86 (95% CI = 1.71-2.01; Alternative Healthy Eating Index). When the age threshold for healthy aging was shifted to 75 years, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index diet showed the strongest association with healthy aging, with an odds ratio of 2.24 (95% CI = 2.01-2.50). Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes and low-fat dairy products were linked to greater odds of healthy aging, whereas higher intakes of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages and red or processed meats (or both) were inversely associated. Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may enhance overall healthy aging, guiding future dietary guidelines.",0
40128240,The AROMHA brain health test is a remote olfactory assessment to screen for cognitive impairment.,"Cost-effective, noninvasive screening methods for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurocognitive disorders remain an unmet need. The olfactory neural circuits develop AD pathological changes prior to symptom onset. To probe these vulnerable circuits, we developed the digital remote AROMHA Brain Health Test (ABHT), an at-home odor identification, discrimination, memory, and intensity assessment. The ABHT was self-administered among cognitively normal (CN) English and Spanish speakers (n = 127), participants with subjective cognitive complaints (SCC; n = 34), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 19). Self-administered tests took place remotely at home under unobserved (among interested CN participants) and observed modalities (CN, SCC, and MCI), as well as in-person with a research assistant present (CN, SCC, and MCI). Olfactory performance was similar across observed and unobserved remote self-administration and between English and Spanish speakers. Odor memory, identification, and discrimination scores decreased with age, and olfactory identification and discrimination were lower in the MCI group compared to CN and SCC groups, independent of age, sex, and education. The ABHT revealed age-related olfactory decline, and discriminated CN older adults from those with cognitive impairment. Replication of our results in other populations would support the use of the ABHT to identify and monitor individuals at risk for developing dementia.",0
40128188,Determining the Role of Sex and APOE4 status on Psychosis in Alzheimer's Disease.,"BackgroundPsychosis occurs in approximately 41% of patients living with Alzheimer's disease. Previous findings from our group based on analyses of a neuropathological cohort suggest that among AD patients with Lewy Body pathology, female APOE4 homozygotes are at significantly greater risk of psychosis. This study aims to replicate this finding in a clinical cohort using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.MethodsOur group used data from a sample of patients with AD in the ADNI database from the ADNI1, ADNI2, ADNI3, and ADNIGO studies. We defined psychosis status as experiencing hallucinations or delusions at one time point based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. We then used forward binary logistic regression to determine if sex and APOE4 status are predictors of AD + P.ResultsIn total there were 204 participants who met the inclusion criteria, 133 of which were male, and 71 of which were female. Fifty-six patients were",0
40127970,"Feasibility and Acceptability of the ""About Me"" Care Card as a Tool for Engaging Older Adults in Conversations About Cognitive Impairment.","We aimed to address fears and lived experiences of cognitive decline among adults via whole-person conversations that elicit problems and goals that matter most to patients. Currently, 6.7 million Americans have Alzheimer disease or related dementias, with an additional 28 million people reporting subjective cognitive decline-a possible indicator of Alzheimer disease and related dementias. A review of tools for older adults with cognitive impairment showed strong clinical specificity, with insufficient whole-person support for patients. We developed and tested the feasibility and acceptability of a tool to enhance conversations for adults with cognitive impairment at the point of care. We conducted a feasibility study to build a conversation tool, guided by principles of shared decision making, called the ""About Me"" Care Card. Informed by an environmental scan, we created and pilot-tested prototypes at implementation sites. All phases were overseen by a multidisciplinary steering committee. Fourteen diverse clinicians consisting of 7 clinician types across 7 institutions piloted the card during in-person visits or by telephone. Observations showed that the card (1) allowed time to elicit what matters most to patients, (2) created space for personalized care conversations, (3) opened an examination of social care needs, and (4) moderated emotional relationships between families and individuals. A community-based codesign process led to a feasible tool for primary care teams to facilitate whole-person conversations with aging adults. The About Me Care Card appeared to broaden conversations compared with routine care. More work is needed to determine scalability and effects on outcomes.",0

40127821,"Neurotrophic Factor Neuritin Ameliorates Streptozotocin-Induced Alzheimer's Disease-Like Impairment of Memory, Neuroinflammation, Apoptotic Factors and Compensates Hippocampal Neuritin Expression.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly, and is becoming one of the most expensive and deadly diseases. Deficiency of neurotrophic factors signaling is an important cause of this disease. Therefore, we investigated whether neuritin as a neurotrophic factor can have a neuroprotective effect against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD. The animals were bilaterally injected with intra hippocampal-STZ (3mg/kg). Different concentrations of neuritin (0.5, 1, 1.5µg/rat) were administrated 15min before STZ injection. After 14 days, the rats were evaluated for cognitive performance using novel object recognition (NOR), open field and Morris water maze (MWM) tests and then sacrificed for biochemical analysis (by real-time PCR and western blot examinations). The results demonstrated that the STZ- induced learning and memory impairments were significantly prevented by 1.5µg neuritin. Moreover, the increased levels of inflammatory factors (NF-κb, TNF-α and IL-1β) and apoptotic parameters (cytochrome c and caspase‑3) in STZ- treated rats were also significantly decreased by neuritin. In addition, hippocampal neuritin gene expression was downregulated by STZ injection, which was reversed by intra hippocampal neuritin injection. In conclusion, the present study suggests that neuritin prevents cognitive defects in AD rat model and its expression level is associated with cognitive resilience.",0
40127389,Association of Cardiovascular Health With Brain Volume and White Matter Integrity: Results of the SOL-INCA MRI Study.,"Better cardiovascular health (CVH), measured using the Life's Simple 7 (LS7) score, is associated with improved cognitive function. However, its effect on brain imaging in Hispanics/Latinos has not been reported. We investigated the association of LS7 score with brain MRI outcomes in a diverse Hispanic/Latino population. Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) is the largest prospective cohort study of diverse Hispanic/Latino adults in the United States. LS7 score was assessed at baseline (2008-2011). The SOL-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) MRI ancillary study recruited HCHS/SOL participants who underwent neuroimaging approximately 10 years (2017-2022) later. Main outcomes include standardized residuals for total brain, total and lobar gray matter (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital), total white matter, total CSF, lateral ventricle (LV), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes and diffusion tensor imaging (mean free water fraction, peak width skeletonized mean diffusivity, and mean fractional anisotropy). MRI outcomes across continuous LS7 scores were investigated using adjusted linear regression models. We performed an interaction analysis by age and sex. All analyses accounted for complex sample design. The study included 2,659 participants (weighted %female = 56%). The mean age (95% CI) was 54 (53-55) years, and the mean LS7 score was 7.2 (7.1-7.3). In the fully adjusted model, higher LS7 scores were associated with larger total and lobar brain volumes (β We found that better CVH is associated with better brain-based volumes and microstructural integrity and that the effects of LS7 score on brain health are age dependent. Additional studies are needed to assess the longitudinal effect of CVH on MR-based brain health outcomes.",0
40127268,Central TYK2 inhibition identifies TYK2 as a key neuroimmune modulator.,"GWAS have identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) variants in multiple inflammatory disorders, specifically a protective hypomorphic TYK2 allele (P1104A) in multiple sclerosis (MS). Impaired TYK2 signaling within the central nervous system (CNS) may impart the protective effects of TYK2 P1104A allele in MS. We deployed brain-penetrant TYK2 inhibitors (cTYK2i) alongside the peripherally restricted TYK2 inhibitor (pTYK2i; BMS-986165) to untangle the contributions of central TYK2 inhibition in diverse models of neuroinflammation. While pTYK2i had little impact, cTYK2i reduced clinical score, lymphoid cell infiltration, and cytokines/chemokines in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Microglial activation was attenuated in cTYK2i-treated EAE spinal cords and circulating neurofilament light (NfL) was reduced in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, cTYK2i was protective in an antibody-mediated mouse model of primary progressive MS (PPMS). Finally, we demonstrate TYK2 inhibition has a robust impact on a unique subset of activated astrocytes termed Interferon-Responsive-Reactive-Astrocytes (IRRA). The data presented herein identify a key role for CNS TYK2 signaling in regulating neuroinflammation and solidify TYK2 as a potential therapeutic target for MS.",0

40127044,Identification of Ferroptosis- and Hypoxia-related Genes in iPSC-derived Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells from Multiple Sclerosis Patients.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by demyelination, with failed remyelination leading to progressive axon loss in chronic stages. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are critical for remyelination. Recent studies suggest that both hypoxia and ferroptosis play crucial roles in the dysfunctional differentiation of OPCs. This research seeks to identify key genes linked to hypoxia and ferroptosis and immune infiltration characteristics in OPCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of MS patients and to construct a diagnostic model centered on these pivotal genes. We analyzed gene expression data from the GSE196575 and GSE147315 datasets and compared MS patients with healthy individuals. Using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), we pinpointed primary module genes and essential genes associated with hypoxia, ferroptosis, and MS. The ferroptosis Z score and the hypoxia Z score calculated via gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were greater in the iPSC-derived OPCs of MS patients than those of the control group. The implicated genes are predominantly linked to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, as identified through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of crucial genes revealed 10 central hub genes (COL4A1, COL4A2, ITGB5, ITGB1, ITGB8, ITGAV, VIM, FLNA, VCL, and SPARC). The robust expression of ITGB1, ITGB8, and VIM was validated in the GSE151306 dataset, supporting their role as key hub genes. Additionally, an interaction network between transcription factors (TFs) and hub genes was established via Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text (TRRUST), which identified five key TFs. The results of this study could help elucidatenovel biomarkers or therapeutic targets for MS.",0
40126781,Multi-center QA of ultrahigh-field systems.,"Over the past two decades, ultra-high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved from pure investigational devices to now systems with CE and FDA clearance for clinical use. UHF MRI offers enhanced diagnostic value, especially in brain and musculoskeletal imaging, aiding in the differential diagnosis of conditions like multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. However, to fully harness the potential of UHF, multi-center studies and quality assurance (QA) protocols are critical for ensuring reproducibility across different systems and sites. This becomes even more vital as the UHF community comprises three generations of magnet design, and many UHF sites are currently upgrading to the latest system architecture. Hence, this review presents multi-center QA measurements that have been performed at UHF, in particular from larger consortia through their ""travelling heads"" studies. Despite the technical variability between different vendors and system generations, these studies have shown a high level of reproducibility in structural and quantitative imaging. Furthermore, the review highlights the ongoing challenges in QA, such as transmitter performance drift and the need for a standard reliable multi-tissue phantom for RF coil calibration, which are crucial for advancing UHF MRI in both clinical and research applications.",0
40126760,Distinct cerebral perfusion patterns and linguistic profiles in Alzheimer's disease-related primary progressive aphasia.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related primary progressive aphasia (PPA) exhibits considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation and neuroimaging patterns. No studies have quantitatively assessed cerebral perfusion patterns or systematically evaluated the internal heterogeneity of linguistic and neuroimaging features in this population. This study aimed to investigate cerebral hypoperfusion patterns and elucidate their correlation with diverse linguistic features in patients with AD-related PPA using a data-driven approach. Eleven patients with AD-related PPA and 34 with non-AD-related PPA were categorized based on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and their single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data were analyzed. Cerebral hypoperfusion was assessed across 56 regions of interest (ROIs) covering the entire cerebral hemisphere. Sparse principal component (sPC) analysis was performed on the AD-related PPA group to identify distinct patterns of cerebral perfusion reduction and correlate these components with clinical assessments of linguistic abilities. AD-derived sPCs were identified, reflecting hypoperfusion patterns in the left temporoparietal, frontal, and temporal pole regions, corresponding to regions typically associated with logopenic, nonfluent, and semantic variants. In both AD-PPA and non-AD-PPA, the sPC corresponding to the anterior temporal region was associated with semantic comprehension deficits, whereas that corresponding to the frontal region was linked to nonfluent speech and Kana writing impairment. sPC-based hierarchical clustering revealed clusters corresponding to logopenic, nonfluent, and semantic variants, with the anomic subtype distinguished from logopenic PPA. AD-positive cases were distributed across these clusters, emphasizing AD-PPA heterogeneity. These findings suggested that AD-related PPA heterogeneity is reflected in distinct cerebral perfusion patterns, which correlate with varying linguistic deficits.",0
40126739,Innovative approaches in acetylcholinesterase inhibition: a pathway to effective Alzheimer's disease treatment.,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are essential in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, as they prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby enhancing cognitive function. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the structural motifs and mechanisms governing AChEI pharmacological activity, with a focus on medicinal chemistry strategies to enhance potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties. Beginning with the physiological role of acetylcholinesterase in neurological disorders, the review explores the historical evolution of AChEIs and highlights key structural interactions with catalytic, peripheral anionic, and allosteric binding sites. Advances in computational modeling, virtual screening, and structure-based drug design are discussed, alongside emerging approaches, such as multi-target-directed ligands and prodrugs. Additionally, the significance of natural products and drug repurposing in identifying novel AChEI scaffolds is emphasized, contributing to chemical diversity and innovation in drug discovery. By integrating computational tools, expansive chemical libraries, and innovative design strategies, this review identifies promising directions for developing effective AChEIs. These advancements hold great potential in addressing the multifaceted nature of neurodegenerative diseases and improving therapeutic interventions.",0
40126601,HDAC3 as an Emerging Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease and other Neurological Disorders.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aged population. Histone acetylation is a major epigenetic mechanism linked to memory formation and cognitive function. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues in histone proteins. Although pan-HDAC inhibitors are effective in ameliorating AD phenotypes in preclinical models, they are associated with potential unfavorable adverse effects and barely translated into clinical trials. Therefore, the development of novel HDAC inhibitors with a well isoform-selectivity has been desired in AD drug discovery. Among various HDAC isoforms, HDAC3 is highly expressed in neurons and exhibits detrimental effects on synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Moreover, HDAC3 provokes neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity and contributes to AD pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight HDAC3 as an attractive therapeutic target for disease-modifying therapy in AD. In addition, we discuss the therapeutic potential of HDAC3 inhibitors in other neurological disorders.",0
40126600,Metformin Improves Spatial Memory and Reduces Seizure Severity in a Rat Model of Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease comorbidity via PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.,"Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy. In our previous studies, we identified a partial AD-like phenotype associated with central insulin resistance in the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR), a genetic model of epilepsy. We also found that intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin, a compound used to model diabetes and AD, exacerbates seizure susceptibility. Given the role of insulin signaling in both AD and epilepsy, we hypothesized that metformin (MET), an anti-diabetic drug known for enhancing insulin sensitivity, could be a potential therapeutic agent for both conditions. Our objective was to investigate MET's effects on brain insulin signaling, seizure activity, and AD-like pathology in WARs. Adult male WARs received oral MET (250 mg/kg) for 21 days. Audiogenic seizures were assessed using the Categorized Severity Index and Racine's scale. Spatial memory was tested with the Morris water maze (MWM), followed by Western blot analysis of hippocampal proteins. MET significantly reduced seizure severity and improved MWM performance. Although MET did not affect insulin receptor levels or activation, it increased phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), activated Akt, and increased glycogen synthase kinase-3α/β (GSK-3α/β) levels. MET also decreased amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP) levels but did not affect Tau phosphorylation. These results suggest that chronic MET treatment alleviates behaviors related to both AD and epilepsy in WARs and modulates insulin signaling independently of insulin receptor activation. Our findings highlight MET's potential as a therapeutic agent for managing comorbid AD and epilepsy, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms of action.",0
40126150,Utilizing Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy to Improve Cognitive Function in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease by Activating Autophagy-Related Signaling Pathways.,"To investigate the impact of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on the cognitive function of mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), while also identifying the cellular pathways associated with autophagy involved in the treatment. Twenty-four APP/PSl double transgenic mice were randomly assigned to either Group A or Group B, while another 24 C57 mice were randomly allocated to Group C or Group D. HBOT was administered to mice in Group B and Group D, and the Morris water maze test was used to assess changes in mice behavior. Histological examination using hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted to observe pathological alterations in the hippocampus of the mice brain tissue. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to analyze autophagy-related gene pathways in the hippocampus of the mice. Following HBOT, mice in Group B exhibited a significant reduction in escape latency and a notable increase in residence time within the target quadrant compared with Group A (P<0.05), as well as Group C and Group D (P<0.01). The hippocampal neurons in Group A and Group B mice exhibited disorganized arrangements, characterized by pyknosis and margination. Conversely, neurons in Group C displayed orderly arrangements, retaining intact structures with round nuclei demonstrating clear nuclear staining and normal morphology. The cellular morphology of mice in Group D remained unaffected. PCR analysis revealed no notable disparity in autophagy-related gene expression between Group A and Group C. However, the expression levels of five genes including Tgfb1, Mapk14, Bid, Atg7, and Akt1, were significantly elevated in Group B compared to Group A. HBOT has the potential to improve the cognitive function in mice modeled with AD. This improvement of cognitive function appears to be mediated by the up-regulation of autophagy-related genes, specifically Tgfb1, Mapk14, Bid, Atg7, and Akt1. These results indicate that HBOT may offer a therapeutic strategy for treating AD by enhancing autophagy mechanisms.

Here, we explored the role and molecular mechanism of BBR in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to determine AD pathology-associated gene modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were also identified. GO and KEGG analyses were performed for gene function and signaling pathway annotation. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay was applied to analyze cell viability. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining assay was conducted to measure the levels of polarization markers. The production of inflammatory cytokines was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected using a ROS detection kit and a MMP Detection Kit (JC-1), respectively. AD pathology-associated DEGs were applied for GO function annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis, and the results uncovered that AD pathology was related to immune and inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure induced the M1 phenotype of microglia, and BBR suppressed LPS-induced M1 polarization and induced microglia toward M2 polarization. Through co-culture of microglia and neuronal cells, we found that BBR exerted a neuro-protective role by attenuating the injury of LPS-induced HMC3 on SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanically, BBR switched the M1/M2 phenotypes of microglia by activating PI3K-AKT signaling. In summary, BBR protected neuronal cells from activated microglia-mediated neuro-inflammation by switching the M1/M2 polarization in LPS-induced microglia via activating PI3K-AKT signaling. Key words Alzheimer's Disease, Berberine, Microglia polarization, Neuroinflammation, PI3K-AKT signaling.",0

40125832,Aloe-Emodin Improves Mitophagy in Alzheimer's Disease via Activating the AMPK/PGC-1α/SIRT3 Signaling Pathway.,"Impaired mitophagy results in the accumulation of defective mitochondria that are unable to be cleared effectively in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aloe-emodin (AE), a key component of the traditional Chinese medicine Rhubarb, exhibits neuroprotective effects against Alzheimer's disease, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Studying aloe-emodin's role in enhancing mitophagy is vital for improving cognitive function and reducing neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease. The APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were adopted as models for AD to assess the effects of aloe-emodin upon cognitive function and its neuroprotective impact on hippocampal neurons. Additionally, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of proteins within the aforementioned pathway, and the morphological characteristics of mitophagy-related proteins. An AD hippocampal neuron model was developed using Aβ25-35 to evaluate the mitochondrial function, the protein expression of such a pathway and the mitophagy. This approach aims to elucidate the effects and underlying mechanisms of aloe-emodin in relation to AD. AE activates mitophagy in neurons, improves cognitive dysfunction, reduces hippocampal damage, and alleviates AD symptoms in model mice. AE activates the expression of AMPK, PGC-1α and SIRT3. Increased expression of SIRT3 in mitochondria promotes mitophagy and regulates the function of mitochondrial proteins. When mitochondrial autophagy is enhanced, the expression of Beclin1, LC3, P62, Parkin, and PINK1-related proteins changes. Further in vitro experiments showed that AE can enhance mitochondrial function in Alzheimer's disease cell models. The mitochondrial membrane potential, GSH, ROS and Ca2+ levels gradually recover, alleviating the pathological manifestations of AD. Knocking down SIRT3 leads to increased mitochondrial damage and a reduction in mitophagy in HT22 cells. Experimental results show that AE can activate mitophagy through AMPK/PGC-1α/SIRT3 pathway, alleviate cognitive dysfunction in AD, and reduce damage to hippocampal neurons.",0
40125804,High-Frequency rTMS Improves Visual Working Memory in Patients With aMCI: A Cognitive Neural Mechanism Study.,"Visual working memory (VWM), which is an essential component of higher cognitive processes, declines with age and is associated with the progression from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive impairment, particularly in VWM, is prominent in aMCI and may indicate disease progression. This study investigates the cognitive neural mechanisms responsible for VWM impairment in aMCI, with a focus on identifying the VWM processing stages affected. The study targets the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to investigate its influence on VWM in aMCI patients. The role of the DLPFC in the top-down control of VWM processing is central to understanding rTMS effects on the stages of information processing in aMCI-related VWM impairments. A 7-day rTMS intervention was performed in 25 aMCI patients and 15 healthy elderly controls to investigate its effects on VWM and cognitive functions. Tasks included VWM change detection, digital symbol transformation, and the Stroop task for attention and executive functions. EEG analyses consisting of ERP, ERSP, and functional connectivity (wPLI) were integrated. The first part of the study addressed the cognitive neural mechanism of VWM impairment in aMCI and differentiated the processing stages using EEG. The second part investigated the effects of rTMS on EEG processing at different VWM stages and revealed cognitive neural mechanisms that improve visual working memory in aMCI. The results indicated a significant deterioration of VWM tasks in aMCI, especially in accuracy and memory capacity, with prolonged reaction time and increased duration of the Stroop task. In the VWM memory encoding phase, N2pc amplitude, α-oscillation in the parieto-occipital region, and θ-band synchronization in the frontoparietal connectivity decreased. Conversely, rTMS improved N2pc amplitude, α-oscillation, and θ-band synchronization, which correlated with improved frontoparietal connectivity, parieto-occipital α-oscillation, and attentional capacity. Patients with aMCI experience significant deterioration in VWM function, particularly during the encoding phase. This deterioration manifests in reduced accuracy and capacity of memory performance, accompanied by a significant decrease in N2pc amplitude, alpha oscillations, and theta-band connectivity in frontoparietal and fronto-occipital brain regions. rTMS proves to be a promising intervention that improves VWM, attention, and executive functions. In particular, it supports attention during target selection by increasing N2pc amplitude during encoding, enhancing alpha oscillations for better suppression of irrelevant information, and increasing synchronization in frontoparietal and occipital functional connectivity, which ultimately improves visual working memory.",0
40125707,Role of Testosterone Signaling in Microglia: A Potential Role for Sex-Related Differences in Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is less prevalent in men than in women, although mechanisms remain unclear. Microglia degrade aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) through the lysosomal system, including autophagy. G protein-coupled receptor family C group 6 member A (GPRC6A), predominantly expressed in mouse microglial MG6 cells, is a primary mediator of testosterone signaling. This study examines testosterone's role in modulating Aβ-induced autophagy in microglia. Testosterone promotes Aβ-induced autophagy leading to Aβ clearance in MG6 cells by suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and subsequently inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, which is abrogated by shRNA knockdown of GPRC6A. In in vivo experiments with male 5xFAD AD model mice, Aβ clearance activity is associated with autophagy in microglia and is reduced by orchiectomy, but restored by testosterone supplementation. ERK phosphorylation in the brains of male AD model mice is upregulated by orchiectomy. Therefore, testosterone is involved in autophagy-mediated Aβ clearance in microglia. Aβ accumulation in human brain samples from patients with AD is significantly lower in men than in women, with less pronounced colocalization of Aβ with p62 aggregates, suggesting enhanced autophagic activity in men. In conclusion, testosterone enhances Aβ-induced autophagy in microglia, possibly contributing to lower susceptibility to AD in men.",0

40125338,Identifying reversible psychiatric dementia mimics in new memory clinic outpatients.,"Timely identification of reversible conditions that mimic dementia is critical in memory clinic practice. However, psychiatric conditions as potential dementia mimics have not been studied as thoroughly as neurological ones, and detailed data on their reversibility remain limited. To identify reversible psychiatric dementia mimics. A retrospective chart review was conducted on 749 new outpatients to investigate etiologies, progression rates, a neuropsychological assessment, cognitive and functional levels, and potential reversibility, categorized by psychiatric and neurological conditions. Cases showing cognitive reversibility following treatment were also identified. Comparisons were made based on the presence or absence of potential reversibility, as well as actual reversibility. Among the 749 individuals, 121 (16.2%) had potentially reversible conditions: 75 psychiatric and 46 neurological. Psychiatric conditions included depression, schizophrenia and delusional disorders, developmental disorders, alcohol use disorder, and dissociative and anxiety disorders. Compared to individuals without potentially reversible conditions, individuals with psychiatric conditions were younger, had a faster progression rate, and demonstrated higher cognitive function. Of the individuals who had mild cognitive impairment or dementia mimic, 6 (0.9%) showed complete cognitive resolution (3 cases) or partial cognitive improvement (3 cases). These 6 cases included two individuals with psychiatric conditions manifesting psychotic features. While rare, reversible psychiatric dementia mimics highlight the importance of comprehensive evaluations in memory clinics, particularly for younger individuals experiencing rapid cognitive decline. The infrequency of reversibility may reflect a strong association between these potentially reversible conditions and dementia risk factors, or their role as prodromes of dementia itself.",0
40125337,Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of fenugreek in preventing mice model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease and the most prevalent form of dementia. Fenugreek seeds possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, making them valuable therapeutic agents in managing neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to investigate the primary biological pathways and specific mechanisms underlying the protective effects of fenugreek in preventing mice of AD by employing bioinformatics and experimental verification. We administered fenugreek extract as an intervention in mice model of AD and then assessed their cognitive ability and histopathological changes. We predicted the key target genes associated with fenugreek action on AD and the main biological pathways using the bioinformatics method. Furthermore, we observed the different expression of target genes by western blot (WB). The bioinformatics analysis revealed a strong correlation between fenugreek and AD. The behavioral experiments confirmed that fenugreek improved the behavioral and cognitive dysfunction in mice with AD. The histopathology revealed significant changes that fenugreek can inhabit Nissl bodies. Western blot experiments confirmed that fenugreek exerted statistically significant modulatory effects on the levels of inflammatory proteins [interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-1β] and oxidative stress-related proteins (amyloid-β protein precursor, apolipoprotein E, and presenilin 1). This study suggested that fenugreek might be involved in the AD pathway and effectively prevented the progression of AD through significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.",0
40125336,The effects of coagulation factors on the risk of Alzheimer's disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies indicate a complex relationship between coagulation factors and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the current findings are inconsistent, and it remains uncertain whether a causal relationship exists. This study utilizes a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the causal relationships between blood levels of coagulation factors and AD risk. Eleven coagulation factors with valid instrumental variables available were evaluated. Two independent cohorts of European ancestry with AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were used: UK Biobank (UKB, N = 472,868) and the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP, N = 63,926). We primarily conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using the Inverse variance weighted (IVW). Meanwhile, the MR-Egger intercept test is used to detect horizontal pleiotropy, the Residual Sum of Squares observed (RSSobs) is used to assess the model's goodness of fit, and the leave-one-out analysis is employed for sensitivity analysis. Using IVW analysis, the UKB database shows positive correlations of Protein C (PC, p = 0.002), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT, p = 0.019), and coagulation factor X (FX, p = 0.032) with AD, and a negative association for coagulation factor XI (FXI, p = 0.021). The IGAP database mirrors these findings for PC and FXI but not for the others. Leave-one-out analysis showed an anomaly after a single single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) driving, yet the overall results remained stable. This study demonstrates that elevated levels of PC, FX, and aPTT, along with reduced levels of FXI, are causally associated with an increased risk of AD. These findings might pave the way for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",0

Unlike small interfering RNA (siRNA), which is known for gene silencing in RNA interference (RNAi), synthetic saRNAs can stably upregulate target gene expression at the transcriptional level through the assembly of the RNA-induced transcriptional activation (RITA) complex. Moreover, the dual functionality of endogenous miRNAs in RNAa (hereafter referred to as mi-RNAa) reveals their complex role in cellular processes and disease pathology. Emerging studies suggest saRNAs' potential as a novel therapeutic modality for diseases such as metabolic disorders, hearing loss, tumors, and Alzheimer's. Notably, MTL-CEBPA, the first saRNA drug candidate, shows promise in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, while RAG-01 is being explored for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, highlighting clinical advancements in RNAa.

40125089,"Osteoimmunology in Osteoarthritis: Unraveling the Interplay of Immunity, Inflammation, and Joint Degeneration.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease influenced by multiple factors, with its etiology arising from intricate interactions among mechanical stress, inflammatory processes, and disruptions in bone metabolism. Recent research in bone immunology indicates that immune-mediated mechanisms significantly contribute to the progression of OA, highlighting the interactions among immune cells, cytokine networks, and bone components. Immune cells interact with osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes in a variety of ways. These interactions foster a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, contributing to cartilage breakdown, synovial inflammation, and the sclerosis of subchondral bone. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of bone immunology in OA, focusing on the critical role of immune cells and their cytokine-mediated feedback loops in the pathophysiology of OA. In addition, we are exploring novel therapeutic strategies targeting bone immune pathways, including macrophage polarization, T-cell differentiation, and stem cell therapy to restore the metabolic balance between immunity and bone. By integrating cutting-edge research in bone immunology, this review integrates the latest advancements in bone immunology to construct a comprehensive framework for unraveling the pathogenesis of OA, laying a theoretical foundation for the development of innovative precision therapies.",0

40124704,BrainNeXt: novel lightweight CNN model for the automated detection of brain disorders using MRI images.,"The main aim of this study is to propose a novel convolutional neural network, named BrainNeXt, for the automated brain disorders detection using magnetic resonance images (MRI) images. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the performance of our proposed network on various medical applications. To achieve high/robust image classification performance, we gathered a new MRI dataset belonging to four classes: (1) Alzheimer's disease, (2) chronic ischemia, (3) multiple sclerosis, and (4) control. Inspired by ConvNeXt, we designed BrainNeXt as a lightweight classification model by incorporating the structural elements of the Swin Transformers Tiny model. By training our model on the collected dataset, a pretrained BrainNeXt model was obtained. Additionally, we have suggested a feature engineering (FE) approach based on the pretrained BrainNeXt, which extracted features from fixed-sized patches. To select the most discriminative/informative features, we employed the neighborhood component analysis selector in the feature selection phase. As the classifier for our patch-based FE approach, we utilized the support vector machine classifier. Our recommended BrainNeXt approach achieved an accuracy of 100% and 91.35% for training and validation. The recommended model obtained the test classification accuracy of 94.21%. To further improve the classification performance, we suggested a patch-based DFE approach, which achieved a test accuracy of 99.73%. The obtained results, surpassing 90% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness and high classification performance of the proposed models.",0
40124487,Identification and catalog of viral transcriptional regulators in human diseases.,"Viral genomes encode viral transcriptional regulators (vTRs) that manipulate host gene expression to facilitate replication and evade immune detection. Nevertheless, their role in non-cancerous diseases remains largely underexplored. Here, we unveiled 268 new candidate vTRs from 14 of the 20 viral families we investigated. We mapped vTRs' genome-wide binding profiles and identified their potential human targets, which were enriched in immune-mediated pathways, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancers. Through vTR DNA-binding preference analysis, 283 virus-specific and human-like motifs were identified. Prioritized Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vTR target genes were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The partitioned heritability study among 19 diseases indicated significant enrichment of these diseases in EBV vTR-binding sites, implicating EBV vTRs' roles in immune-mediated disorders. Finally, drug repurposing analysis pinpointed candidate drugs for MS, asthma, and Alzheimer disease.

40124421,Traumatic Brain Injury and Alzheimer's Disease: A Shared Neurovascular Hypothesis.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). TBI and AD share several histopathological hallmarks: namely, beta-amyloid aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and plasma protein infiltration. The relative contributions of these proteinopathies and their interplay in the pathogenesis of both conditions remains unclear although important differences are emerging. This review synthesises emerging evidence for the critical role of the neurovascular unit in mediating protein accumulation and neurotoxicity in both TBI and AD. We propose a shared pathogenic cascade centred on a neurovascular unit, in which increased blood-brain barrier permeability induces a series of noxious mechanisms leading to neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction and ultimately cognitive dysfunction in both conditions. We explore the application of this hypothesis to outstanding research questions and potential treatments for TBI and AD, as well as other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions. Limitations of this hypothesis, including the challenges of establishing a causal relationship between neurovascular damage and proteinopathies, are also discussed.",0
40124420,Inhibition of Mitochondrial Dynamics by Mitochondrial Division Inhibitor-1 Suppresses Cell Migration and Metastatic Markers in Colorectal Cancer HCT116 Cells.,"The mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. The mitochondrial morphology and spatial distribution within the cell is determined by fusion and fission processes of mitochondria. Several studies have used mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi.1) to explore the roles of mitochondrial dynamics in various pathological conditions, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and cancers. The objective of the study was to investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the invasiveness of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. MTT assay was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced toxicity in HCT116 cells. Wound healing, cell migration and colony forming assays were adopted to measure the migration and invasion activity of HCT116 cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the Mdivi.1-induced mitochondrial mass quantification, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species generation in HCT116 cells. Additionally, Western Blot analysis was used to determine the expression level of Drp1, p-Drp1, Mnf2, AMPK-α, p-AMPK-α, Cox-2, iNos and MMP9 in HCT116 cells. We found that Mdivi.1 induced toxicity and altered the morphology of HCT116 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Mdivi.1 significantly increased mitochondrial mass and dissipated the mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, Mdivi.1 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial superoxide production, leading to AMPK activation. Moreover, Mdivi.1 decreased dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) and phosphorylated-Drp1 expression and increased mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) expression in a concentration-dependent manner at 48 and 72 h post-treatment. Notably, Mdivi.1 induced inhibition of translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Mdivi.1 significantly suppressed the invasion and migration of HCT116 cells and inhibited the formation of HCT116 cell colonies. In addition, Mdivi.1 significantly decreased the expression of metastatic markers including Cox-2, iNos, and MMP-9 in HCT116 cells. Collectively, this study revealed that Mdivi.1 downregulates Drp1, upregulates Mfn2, and increases mitochondrial mass with attenuated oxidative metabolism, leading to the inhibition of cell invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer HCT116 cells. Mitochondrial dynamics are regarded as possible drug targets for interrupting colorectal cancer cell migration and metastasis. The mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles. This study aimed to investigate the role of a mitochondrial fission inhibitor (Mdivi.1) on the viability, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 cells), as well as the underlying mechanisms. We found that Mdivi.1 inhibited cell viability and migration via mechanisms linked to changes in mitochondrial dynamics, reactive oxygen species generation, and the downregulation of metastatic markers.

Traditional diagnostic methods for AD and OSA, like cerebrospinal fluid analysis and polysomnography, are invasive and challenging for people with DS.

We performed a comprehensive 3D analysis of facial shape variation by registering the 3D coordinates of 21 landmarks on facial models extracted from magnetic resonance images of 131 individuals with DS and 216 euploid (EU) adult controls, including AD and OSA cases. Procrustes ANOVA and MANOVA quantified shape variation by sex, age, and facial size, while geometric morphometrics assessed diagnostic group differences. Significant facial shape differences were observed between the DS and EU groups, indicating sex-dependent differences and altered age-related changes in DS, particularly in females. Facial shape correlated with the amyloid beta ratio (Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40), a key AD biomarker. In DS, facial shape differences by AD diagnosis were not significant after adjusting for age and facial size, but significant shape differences were detected in the EU population. For OSA, facial shape correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and DS individuals with severe OSA showed distinct facial morphology compared with those without OSA, suggesting an association between facial shape and sleep respiratory disturbances. These results highlight the potential of facial morphology as a noninvasive biomarker for AD and OSA detection and management.",0
40123504,Regulation of CNS Lipids by Protease Activated Receptor 1.,"Disruptions in the metabolism of cholesterol and other lipids are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disease. The CNS is highly enriched in cholesterol, which is primarily synthesized de novo. Cholesterol synthesis is also rate limiting for myelin regeneration. Given that knockout of the thrombin receptor (Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1)) accelerates myelin regeneration, here we sought to determine the potential regulatory actions of PAR1 in CNS cholesterol and lipid metabolism in the intact adult CNS and during myelin regeneration. We present quantitative PCR and RNAseq evidence from murine spinal cords at the peak of myelination and in adulthood showing PAR1 knockout is associated with increased gene expression for cholesterol biosynthesis (Hmgcs1, Hmgcr, Sqle, and Dhcr7), lipid transport (ApoE, Abca1, and Ldlr), and intracellular processing (Lcat, Npc1, and Npc2) at one or more time points examined. An upregulation of genes involved in the synthesis of other lipids enriched in the myelin membrane, specifically Fa2h, Ugt8a, and Gal3st1, was also observed in PAR1 knockouts. Transcription factors essential for lipid and cholesterol production (Srebf1 and Srebf2) were also increased in PAR1 knockout spinal cords at the postnatal day 21 peak of myelination and at day 45. GC-MS and LC-MS quantification of lipids demonstrated coordinate increases in the abundance of select cholesterol and lipid species in the spinal cords of PAR1 knockout mice, including enrichment of esterified cholesterol, together with sphingomyelins and sphingolipids. Co-localization of the SREBP1 and SREBP2 transcription factors, as well as HMGCS1, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, to glia during remyelination post-lysolecithin or cuprizone-mediated demyelination showed a prominent regulatory role for PAR1 in Olig2+ oligodendrocytes. PAR1 knockouts also demonstrated elevated levels of SREBP2 in more mature GST3+ oligodendrocytes and SREBP1 in GFAP+ astrocytes during remyelination post-lysolecithin. These findings demonstrate novel roles for PAR1 as a regulator of CNS cholesterol and lipid metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target to increase cholesterol availability to improve myelin regeneration.",0
40123431,Is there a threshold or dose-response association between physical activity and cognitive function in multiple sclerosis?,"Cognitive impairment is prevalent, disabling, and poorly managed in multiple sclerosis (MS). Physical activity, often expressed as steps/day, has been associated with cognitive function in this population. This brief report examined the possibility of a (1) steps/day threshold associated with absence of cognitive impairment or (2) dose-response relationship between steps/day and cognitive function in MS. The sample included 358 persons with MS who provided demographic (age, sex, race) and clinical (MS type, disease duration, disability status) information, and completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II). Participants wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer above the non-dominant hip during waking hours of the day over a 7-day period for measuring steps/day. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis did not identify a steps/day threshold associated with cognitive impairment on SDMT (area under the curve [AUC] ranged between 0.606 and 0.691). The ROC curve analysis further did not identify a threshold of steps/day associated with cognitive impairment based on CVLT-II (AUC range 0.606 to 0.691). The regression analysis indicated significant linear relationships between steps/day and SDMT ( The observed linear relationship suggests that focusing on increasing steps/day across all levels of physical activity might have benefits for cognitive function in MS.",0
40123371,Improving executive functioning and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease with music therapy: A narrative review of potential neural mechanisms.,"The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the concurrent cost of healthcare will increase as the population continues to age. Pharmaceutical interventions effectively manage symptoms of AD but carry side effects and ineffectively address underlying causes and disease prevention. Non-pharmaceutical interventions for AD, such as music training and therapy do not carry these side effects and can improve symptoms, and should therefore be explored as stand-alone or co-therapy for AD. In addition, music encapsulates modifiable lifestyle factors, such as cognitive stimulation, that have been shown to delay progression of and prevent AD. However, the neural mechanisms underpinning how music improves AD symptoms are not fully understood and whether music can target compensatory processes, activate neural networks, or even slow or prevent AD needs further research. Research suggests neural mechanism may involve stimulating brain areas to promote neurogenesis, dopaminergic rewards systems, and the default mode network (DMN). Alternatively, this review proposes that music improve symptoms of AD via the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN), the salience network (SN) and DMN, and neural compensation. This review will then present evidence for how music could activate the FPCN, SN, and DMN to improve their efficiency, organization, and cognitive functions they govern, protecting the brain from damage, slowing progression, and possibly preventing AD. Establishing how music improves symptoms of AD can lead to tailored music therapy protocols that target functional neural networks responsible for impaired executive functions common in AD.",0
40123368,Slight hyperintensity of the left piriform cortex and amygdala on T2-weighted FLAIR images in older adults and patients with probable Alzheimer's disease.,"BackgroundThe left piriform cortex and amygdala (PC&A) is an early target for deterioration due to aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in several neuropathological and magnetic resonance (MR) volumetric studies. We observed slight hyperintensity of the left PC&A in older adults and probable AD (pAD) patients on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2W-FLAIR) images.PurposeTo quantitatively assess the validity of the left PC&A hyperintensity in older adults and pAD patients.Material and MethodsT2W-FLAIR images from three groups were retrospectively evaluated: (i) younger control (YC; n = 77): individuals aged 37.9 ± 8.4 years; (ii) older control (OC; n = 98): individuals aged 76.9 ± 5.3 years without cognitive impairment; and (iii) pAD (n = 35): individuals aged 80.5 ± 6.9 years with pAD. Signal intensity (SI) ratios of the left to right PC&A (L-PC&A/R-PC&A) were calculated for all groups. In the OC and pAD groups, SI ratios of the left PC&A to pons (L-PC&A/P) and the right PC&A to pons (R-PC&A/P) were calculated. The regions of interest were defined as large as possible on transaxial images in which the PC&As were most broadly depicted.ResultsThe mean L-PC&A/R-PC&A in the YC, OC, and pAD groups showed an increasing trend in that sequence",0
40123325,A Case of Fluoroscopy-Induced Subacute Radiation Dermatitis Histologically Mimicking Sclerodermiform Lupus: Immunohistochemical Analysis of Cytotoxic Memory T-Cell Markers.,"The histological hallmark of fluoroscopy-induced subacute radiation dermatitis (FISARD) is basovacuolar interface reaction with satellite cell necrosis mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. Most published cases are described in patients who had a single interventional exposure. Here we report a case of FISARD in a 78-year-old man who underwent two cardiovascular interventions within 2 months. Biopsy of the skin lesion on his left back revealed not only epidermal cytotoxic interface activity with superficial perivascular dermatitis but also deep perivascular and interstitial dermal lymphoid infiltrates and dermal sclerosis, features overlapping with lupus and inflammatory morphea. Immunohistochemistry revealed intraepidermal and dermal expression of CD3, CD8, TIA-1, and CD45RA, likely corresponding to terminally differentiated effector memory cytotoxic T cells (TEMRA). In contrast, expression of CD57, a marker of late memory T-cells implicated in scleroderma pathogenesis, was absent in the epidermis but present in the dermis. This case adds to the spectrum of histopathologic findings of FISARD possibly related to the cumulative radiation injury from multiple fluoroscopic procedures. Given the increasing use of fluoroscopy, recognition of this histopathological pattern could aid in the timely and accurate diagnosis of this condition. A potential role of memory CD8+ T-cells in disease pathogenesis is discussed.",0
40123238,Differential effects of 2 and 4 weeks repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation inducing neuroplasticity on cognitive improvement.,"BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an efficient intervention for alleviating cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the optimal treatment duration for high efficacy remains unclear.ObjectiveThis study investigates the effects of 2-week and 4-week rTMS on neural network plasticity and cognitive improvement, aiming to identify the optimal treatment duration for cognitive impairment.MethodsrTMS was administered to cognitively impaired patients over 2-week and 4-week periods, exploring its effects on cognitive improvement and induced neural circuits. The study also examines the predictive value of these neural circuits for individual treatment responses.ResultsThe 4-week rTMS treatment significantly outperformed the 2-week course in improving cognitive function. Neural activity analysis identified the precuneus as a key region for episodic memory. Changes in brain regions, particularly within the default mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), and motor network (MN), were associated with cognitive improvements. Baseline functional connectivity in these regions predicted changes in general cognition (r = 0.724, p < 0.001) and episodic memory (r = 0.447, p = 0.022) after rTMS.ConclusionsExtended rTMS treatment enhances cognitive performance in cognitive impairment patients, with the 4-week course showing superior effects. Reduced connectivity in the DMN following rTMS was linked to cognitive improvements. The neural network baseline can predict patients' treatment responses.",0
40123187,Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI) and Future Dementia Risk in the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) During 2012-2019.,"BackgroundSubjective cognitive impairment (SCI), assessed in national surveys, offers potential for dementia monitoring and early detection. However, its causal link to dementia risk remains unclear.ObjectiveTo evaluate whether SCI causally affects dementia risk in U.S. older adults (≥65 years), considering mortality as a competing risk.MethodsUsing data from 1622 dementia-free older adults in the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) during 2011-2019, we estimated total, direct, and separable effects of SCI on dementia and mortality risks.ResultsSCI was reported by 7.6% at baseline and associated with a twofold increased dementia risk over 8 years (RR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.07-3.07) and lower mortality risk (RR: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.10-0.67). Direct effect analysis indicated a potential direct causal link between SCI and dementia.ConclusionsSCI predicts dementia onset and inversely affects mortality, highlighting the importance of early detection and precise analytic approaches.",0
40123185,Race and Incident Dementia Among Older Black and Older White Men.,"The objective of this study was to determine if racial differences exist between older Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and White (NHW) men in incident dementia over 11 years (2011-2022) in the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). The analytic sample included 2395 community-dwelling NHB and NHW men free of dementia at baseline who self-identified as Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and White (NHW). Dementia was assessed at each visit using a validated algorithm developed by NHATS. After adjusting for demographics, place, and health-related characteristics in the Cox proportional hazard models, older NHB men had an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio: 1.63, 95% confidence interval: [1.22-2.17]) compared to older NHW men. There may be unique factors such as stressors, patterns of genes, or perhaps nutrition that older NHB men possess and experience throughout their lives that contribute to the increased incident dementia.",0
40123183,"Learning Barriers, Engagement, and Interests Among Low-Income Latino Older Adults: Highlighting the Privilege of Learning and Retirement.","ObjectivesEngagement in learning new skills can potentially foster cognitive and functional growth among low-income Latinos, a population at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. However, they may face unique barriers to learning. The present qualitative study identified learning barriers, learning engagement, and learning interests among low-income Latino older adults.MethodsTwenty Spanish-speaking participants were interviewed utilizing a semi-structured interview protocol. The data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach.ResultsSome of the identified barriers include lacking good health, finances, learning opportunities, technology, proficiency in English, transportation, and motivation. Participants were most interested in learning technology, English, sewing skills, and culinary arts to primarily improve their financial situation.DiscussionThese findings highlight the privilege of prioritizing leisure activities for novel skill learning in old age for those with more financial resources. Our findings promote the need to provide tailored novel skill learning opportunities for underserved populations.",0
40123181,Applying Mixed Methods to Enhance Health Equity in Research on Dementia and Cognitive Impairment.,"ObjectivesThe NIA health disparities research framework details a life course approach that considers multilevel environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors. Mixed methods are well-suited to study complex problems like structural racism, combining the benefits of generalizability with contextualization.MethodsWe draw on experience as faculty in the Mixed Methods Research Training Program for the Health Sciences to introduce mixed methods research on health equity and disparities in dementia and cognitive impairment.ResultsWe describe common reasons why health science investigators may use mixed methods, provide examples of mixed methods designs, and discuss challenges and practicalities of mixed methods research.DiscussionMany risk factors for dementia are modifiable, so the emphasis of research turns from description to intervention studies that enhance health equity. The information and insights acquired from the use of mixed methods are central in tailoring interventions to populations most affected by Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.",0

In addition, we include a paper on how mixed methods can be used to enhance health equity in research on AD/ADRD and cognitive impairment.DiscussionThe Supplement helps fill a critical knowledge gap regarding drivers of disparities in cognitive decline or risk in AD/ADRD, thereby informing future work as it relates to AD/ADRD and health equity.",0
40123178,Subjective Memory Problems and Social Determinants of Health on Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living With Older Adults in the ACTIVE Study.,"ObjectiveThis study examines the longitudinal relationship between subjective memory problems (SMPs) and timed instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) performance while considering the effects of depressive symptoms and the moderating role of the social determinants of health (SDHs).MethodsData from 2622 older adults in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) randomized control trial were analyzed longitudinally, spanning up to 10 years. SMPs and timed IADL performance were assessed at each wave. The SDHs were captured using validated factors incorporating US Census data and person-level data from the ACTIVE Study. Multilevel mixed models examined associations, adjusting for demographics and the effects of depressive symptoms.ResultsMore SMPs at baseline were associated with slower timed IADL performance which rapidly became slower over time. Those older adults who experienced SMPs as they aged also experienced declines in timed IADL. These associations were influenced by socially determined health outcomes such as neighborhood and built environment, healthcare access and quality, and social and community context. Living in a better neighborhood and built environment and having access to quality healthcare weakened relationships over time between baseline SMPs and slower timed IADL performance. Better healthcare access and quality weakened the association of increases in SMPs with the slowing of timed IADL. Contrary to our prediction, living in a better social and community context, which fostered social engagement and decreased social isolation, strengthened relationships over time between baseline SMPs and slower timed IADL performance as well as the association of increases in SMPs with slower timed IADL performance over time.DiscussionMore SMPs at baseline were significantly related to slower rates of timed IADL performance over time, especially in older adults living in worse neighborhoods and built environments as well as areas with better social and community contexts. Increases in SMPs as one aged were also related to the slowing of timed IADL performance, especially in older adults living in areas with worse healthcare access and quality. Finally, our study found that higher scores on SMPs were related to slower timed IADL performance-independent of major confounds such as depressive symptoms.",0
40123175,The Effect of Influenza Vaccination on Hospitalization and Mortality Among People With Dementia.,"People with dementia have an increased risk for infection-related complications, which may be mitigated by common vaccinations. The aim was to investigate the association between influenza vaccination and the rates of all-cause and influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths among older adults with dementia. We followed all Danish residents with dementia aged 65 and above from September 1, 2002, to August 31, 2018. Dementia was defined from records in the Danish national registries (positive predictive value 85.8%). People with dementia were identified on September 1 of each year. On this date, vaccination status was also reset, and the status of covariates was assessed. We used proportional hazard Cox regression to compare rates of all-cause hospitalization, hospitalization with a respiratory infection, hospitalization with influenza or pneumonia, and all-cause mortality for vaccinated and unvaccinated. Across the entire study period, we included 134,002 people with dementia. Rates of hospitalization were 9%-10% lower, and the mortality rate 9% lower, for vaccinated compared to unvaccinated among people with dementia. Influenza vaccination was associated with lower rates of hospitalization and mortality among people with dementia. Further exploration of the preventive potential of influenza vaccination among people with dementia is important for shaping interventions in this vulnerable group.",0
40123156,Unraveling the Controversy: The Causal Link Between Osteoarthritis and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Research on osteoarthritis (OA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently highly controversial, and the upstream and downstream relationships between them remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the association between OA and AD using Mendelian randomization (MR). Summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were obtained for OA and AD. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected as instrumental variables (IVs), and significant (p < 5.0 × 10 The MR results showed a positive causal effect of AD and OA (IVW OR = 19.89, 95% CI = 2.90-136.57, p = 0.002; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.11-1.47, p = 0.017; OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.11-1.46, p = 0.017) and no significance of the reverse MR results (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis of the MR results confirmed this finding and was significant in all population subgroups (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.18-1.40). The findings were maintained after controlling confounders using MVMR (OR = 6.75, 95% CI = 1.50-30.44, p = 0.013). These analyses were confirmed to be reliable and stable by sensitivity testing. Our study found a positive causal effect of OA and AD, which was confirmed by the highest levels of evidence-based medicine. It may provide meaningful evidence for the current controversy.",0
40122980,Generalizability of trial criteria on amyloid-lowering therapy against Alzheimer's disease to individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's disease in the general population.,"Treatment with anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibodies slowed cognitive decline in recent RCTs in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, stringent trial eligibility criteria may affect generalisability to clinical practice. We extracted eligibility criteria for trials of aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab, and applied these to participants with MCI and early clinical AD dementia from the population-based Rotterdam Study. Participants underwent questionnaires, genotyping, brain-MRI, cognitive testing, and cardiovascular assessment. We determined amyloid status using a validated prediction model based on age and APOE-genotype. Of 968 participants (mean age: 75 years, 56% women), 779 had MCI and 189 dementia. Across trials, around 40% of participants would be ineligible because of predicted amyloid negativity. At least one clinical exclusion criterion was present in 76.3% of participants for aducanumab, 75.8% for lecanemab, and 59.8% for donanemab. Common criteria were cardiovascular disease (35.2%), anticoagulant (31.2%), psychotropic or immunological medication use (20.4%), anxiety or depression (15.9%), or lack of social support (15.6%). One-third were ineligible based on brain-MRI findings alone, similar across trials and predominantly due to cerebral small-vessel disease. Combining amyloid, clinical, and imaging criteria, eligibility ranged from 9% (95% CI:7.0-11.1) for aducanumab, 8% (6.2-9.9) lecanemab to 15% (12.4-17.5) for donanemab. Findings from recent RCTs reporting protective effects of monoclonal antibodies against amyloid-β are applicable to less than 15% of community-dwelling individuals with MCI or early AD. These findings underline that evidence for drug efficacy and safety is lacking for the vast majority of patients with MCI/AD in routine clinical practice.",0
40122974,Long-Term Management and Therapeutic Sequencing for Patients with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in France: A Vignette Study.,"We have analysed prescribing decisions for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) of 111 neurologists (""participating physicians"") in France using hypothetical case vignettes. Six case vignettes were presented to participating physicians, each based on realistic, hypothetical clinical interactions between a neurologist and people with active or highly active RMS, with or without prior treatment with a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). ""Disruptive events"" are where the appearance of new MS disease activity, side-effects or other issues prompted the return of the hypothetical patients for a review of their care. A population of 111 participating physicians reviewed the cases and recommended treatments. Our data suggested a willingness among participating physicians to treat with higher-efficacy DMTs early in the course of RMS, with platform agents given to only one-quarter of DMT-naïve cases. MS disease activity was the main driver of switches to higher-efficacy DMTs, although an escalation approach was common in response to either moderate MS disease activity or side-effects on platform agents. A desire for pregnancy drove high usage of cladribine tablets and natalizumab (especially for cases negative for John Cunningham virus). These findings suggest that the management of RMS in France has shifted in recent years towards a desire to achieve earlier and more effective control of disease activity for people with RMS. Better guidance on the sequencing of DMTs for different scenarios within the overall management of RMS may be warranted. This study offers valuable insights into the current practices of French neurologists in managing RMS, emphasizing the complexity of therapeutic decisions, the diversity of strategies, and the significance of an individualized approach in treatment management.",0
40122907,Cerebral lesions in the central pain matrix are associated with headache in multiple sclerosis.,"Headache is very frequent in multiple sclerosis. However, the question whether headache is just coincidental or may be secondary due to inflammatory cerebral multiple sclerosis lesions is yet to be clarified. This study intended to evaluate the distribution of cerebral lesion sites and the potential presence of specific lesion clusters in patients with multiple sclerosis and comorbid headache using voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM). Patients with multiple sclerosis and headache were prospectively identified and included in a university neurological center between 2017 and 2023. Only patients with headache onset after first manifestation of multiple sclerosis were included. Demographic and clinical data were assessed, and lesion volumes calculated. Cerebral lesion sites were correlated voxel-wise with presence and absence of headache using non-parametric permutation testing. A cohort of multiple sclerosis patients served as controls for the VLSM-analysis. 48 multiple sclerosis patients with headache were included, as well as 92 controls without headache. Of the 48 patients with headache, 39 (81%) were female and nine (19%) were male. Mean age was significantly higher in headache patients than in controls (51 + / - 11 vs. 42 + / - 11 years, p < 0.05). EDSS, disease duration and lesion volumes did not significantly differ between both groups. Lesion overlap of all patients demonstrated a distribution of white matter lesions consistently in all subcortical brain areas. The VLSM-analysis showed associations between headache and lesion clusters in the left insula, left hippocampus and right thalamus. In our study, multiple sclerosis lesions in the left insula, left hippocampus and right thalamus were associated with headache in multiple sclerosis patients. The data therefore indicates that headache in multiple sclerosis may, in a proportion of patients, result from lesions in the central nervous systems' pain processing network.Trial registration: No. 93_17 B, Ethics committee of the University Hospital Erlangen-Nürnberg.",0
40122879,Recurrent late-onset neutropenia after ofatumumab treatment in a case of multiple sclerosis.,"Immunomodulatory treatment options for multiple sclerosis show an inverse risk‒benefit ratio of side effects and treatment efficacy. Although rare, anti-B-cell therapies can cause acute or late-onset neutropenia. We report a case of severe recurrent fluctuating neutropenia after ofatumumab treatment. We observed four recurrences even after pausing with ofatumumab and repeated granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment. In total, neutropenia occurred five times and was associated with recurrent pulmonary, urinary tract, and skin infections. Bone marrow investigation revealed no signs of lymphoma or leukemia. Interestingly, routine molecular testing revealed two gene variants of unknown significance for BCORL1 and ASXL1, both of which play a role in hematopoiesis. The neutrophil count recovered spontaneously six months after the cessation of treatment with ofatumumab. This case highlights the necessity of identifying patients at risk and monitoring white blood cell counts regularly for up to 6 months after initial neutropenia.",0
40122810,Enhancing TREM2 expression activates microglia and modestly mitigates tau pathology and neurodegeneration.,"TREM2, a microglia-specific receptor, is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, mediating microglial responses to amyloid pathology critical to AD development. However, its role in tau pathology and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Using the PS19 tauopathy mouse model with inducible overexpression of human wild-type TREM2 (TREM2-WT) or the R47H variant (TREM2-R47H), we show that increasing TREM2-WT expression modestly reduces soluble phosphorylated tau levels and mildly preserves neuronal integrity. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that TREM2-WT robustly enhances microglial activation, characterized by a disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature. In contrast, TREM2-R47H overexpression exhibits a loss-of-function phenotype, with no significant impact on tau levels, neurodegeneration, or microglial activation. These findings highlight the role of TREM2 in modulating microglial activity and its influence on tau pathology and neurodegeneration, providing important insights for the future development of therapies targeting TREM2 or microglial pathways in AD or other tauopathies.",0
40122775,Risk Factors Profile in Dementia Patients at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Nepal: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Dementia is attributable to 12 known risk factors in 40% cases. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of defined risk factors among people living with dementia. 174 patients with dementia and caregivers were interviewed using semi-structured pro forma, risk factors provided by the Lancet Commission on Dementia (2020), and Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS). The prevalence of 11 known risk factors and associations between the risk factors and dementia severity were assessed. The mean age of the participants was 73.9 years (SD = 8.34 years). The education below intermediate level was 83.3%, 17.8% had hearing loss, 37.9% had hypertension, 24.1% had diabetes, 25.9% and 55.2% had alcohol and nicotine harmful use respectively and 8% had a history of traumatic brain injury and obesity each. There is a substantial prevalence of risk factors among people living with dementia in Nepal but no associations between any of the risk factors and dementia severity.",0
40122679,Spliceosome protein alterations differentiate hubs of the default mode connectome during the progression of Alzheimer's disease.,"Default mode network (DMN) is comprised in part of the frontal (FC), precuneus (PreC), and posterior cingulate (PCC) cortex and displays amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The PreC hub appears the most resilient to AD pathology, suggesting differential vulnerability within the DMN. However, the mechanisms that underlie this differential pathobiology remain obscure. Here, we investigated changes in RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and splicing proteins U1-70K, U1A, SRSF2, and hnRNPA2B1, phosphorylated AT8 tau, 3R and 4Rtau isoforms containing neurons and amyloid plaques in layers III and V-VI in FC, PreC, and PCC obtained from individuals with a preclinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild/moderate mAD. We found a significant increase in pS5-RNA pol II levels in FC NCI, U1-70K in PreC MCI and mAD, and hnRNPA2B1 and SRSF2 levels in PCC mAD. 1N3Rtau levels were significantly increased in FC, decreased in PreC in mAD, and unchanged in PCC, whereas 1N4Rtau increased in mAD across the hubs. SRSF2, U1-70K, U1A, and hnRNPA2B1 nuclear optical density (OD), size, and number were unchanged across groups in FC and PCC, while PreC OD hnRNPA2B1 was significantly greater in mAD. Mislocalized U1A and U1-70K tangle-like structures were found in a few PCC cases and colocalized with AT8-bearing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). FC pS5-RNA pol II, PreC U1-70K, Pre pS5,2-RNA pol II, and PCC hnRNPA2B1 and SRSF2 protein levels were associated with cognitive decline but not neuropathology across clinical groups. By contrast, splicing protein nuclear OD measures, size, counts, and mislocalized U1-70K and U1A NFT-like structures were not correlated with NFT or plaque density, cognitive domains, and neuropathological criteria in DMN hubs. Findings suggest that RNA splicing protein alterations and U1 mislocalization contribute differentially to DMN pathogenesis and cognitive deterioration in AD.",0
40122620,Neuroglia and brain energy metabolism.,"The glial control of energy homeostasis is of crucial importance for health and disease. Astrocytes in particular play a major role in controlling the equilibrium among adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), and adenosine. Any energy crisis leads to a drop in ATP, and the resulting increase in adenosine is an evolutionary ancient mechanism to suppress energy-consuming activities. The maintenance of brain energy homeostasis, in turn, requires the availability of energy sources, such as glucose and ketones. Astrocytes have assumed an important role in enabling efficient energy utilization by neurons. In addition, neurons are under the metabolic control of astrocytes through regulation of glutamate and GABA levels. The intricate interplay between glial brain energy metabolism and brain function can be best understood once the homeostatic system of energy metabolism is brought out of control. This has best been studied within the context of epilepsy where metabolic treatments provide unprecedented opportunities for the control of seizures that are refractory to conventional antiseizure medications. This chapter will discuss astroglial energy metabolism in the healthy brain and will use epilepsy as a model condition in which glial brain energy homeostasis is disrupted. We will conclude with an outlook on how those principles can be applied to other conditions such as Alzheimer disease.",0
40122583,A retrospective study on blood microbiota as a marker for cognitive decline: implications for detecting Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment in Republic of Korea.,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between blood microbiota, specifically bacterial DNA, and cognitive decline in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The objective was to identify potential microbial signatures that could serve as biomarkers for cognitive deterioration. Forty-seven participants were recruited, including 13 with aMCI, 20 with SCD, and 14 normal cognition (NC). Blood samples were collected, and microbial DNA was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bioinformatics analyses-including α- and β-diversity measures and differential abundance testing (using edgeR)-were employed to assess microbial diversity and differences in bacterial composition among groups. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive impact of the microbiota on cognitive decline. Microbial diversity differed significantly between groups, with NC exhibiting the highest α-diversity. Both the aMCI and SCD groups showed reduced diversity. Taxa such as Bacteroidia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Clostridia were significantly decreased in the aMCI group compared to NC (p<0.05). In contrast, Gammaproteobacteria increased significantly in the aMCI group compared to both NC and SCD, indicating progressive microbial changes from SCD to aMCI. No significant differences were found between the NC and SCD groups. Distinct bacterial taxa-particularly the increase in Gammaproteobacteria along with decreases in Bacteroidia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Clostridia-are associated with the progression of cognitive decline. These findings suggest that blood microbiota could serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection of aMCI. However, the small sample size and the lack of control for confounding factors such as diet and medication limit the findings. Larger studies are needed to validate these results and further explore the role of microbiota in neurodegeneration.",0

40122399,Advanced Biomarkers: Beyond Amyloid and Tau: Emerging Non-Traditional Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Diagnosis and Progression.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, leads to progressive cognitive decline and imposes a significant socio-economic burden. Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily based on amyloid-beta and tau biomarkers, often identify the disease at late stages, highlighting the need for more sensitive and accessible early detection tools. This review explores emerging non-traditional biomarkers, including salivary, lipid, urinary, synaptic, blood-based, microRNA (miRNA), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and inflammatory markers, which provide deeper insights into AD pathophysiology. These biomarkers reflect key pathological processes such as neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, synaptic damage, lipid dysregulation, and genetic factors. Non-invasive biomarkers, such as those found in saliva and urine, present promising avenues for large-scale screening, while advanced blood-based markers like neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) offer precise monitoring of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, miRNAs and lipid biomarkers shed light on molecular alterations in neuronal health and signaling. Integrating these biomarkers with imaging techniques, proteomics, and genetic profiling enhances diagnostic accuracy and enables personalized treatment approaches. This shift toward multi-dimensional biomarker assessment not only improves early detection but also aids in tailoring therapeutic strategies to individual disease profiles. By reviewing recent advancements, this article highlights the transformative potential of emerging biomarkers in overcoming the limitations of conventional diagnostics. Standardization and validation across diverse populations will be crucial in expanding their clinical applicability, ultimately improving disease management, reducing societal burden, and enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by AD.",0
40122398,Mitophagy in Alzheimer's disease and other metabolic disorders: a focus on mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics.,"Mitochondria, as central regulators of cellular processes such as energy production, apoptosis, and metabolic homeostasis, are essential to cellular function and health. The maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, especially through mitophagy-the selective removal of impaired mitochondria-is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of mitochondrial function, dynamics, and biogenesis is linked to neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease, which is increasingly recognized as a metabolic disorder due to its shared pathophysiologic features: insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in pharmacological interventions, focusing on agents that modulate mitophagy, mitochondrial uncouplers that reduce oxidative phosphorylation, compounds that directly scavenge reactive oxygen species to alleviate oxidative stress, and molecules that ameliorate amyloid beta plaque accumulation and phosphorylated tau pathology. Additionally, we explore dietary and lifestyle interventions-MIND and ketogenic diets, caloric restriction, physical activity, hormone modulation, and stress management-that complement pharmacological approaches and support mitochondrial health. Our review underscores mitochondria's central role in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, particularly AD. By advocating for an integrated therapeutic model that combines pharmacological and lifestyle interventions, we propose a comprehensive approach aimed at mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction and improving clinical outcomes in these complex, interrelated diseases.",0
40122320,Historical Redlining and Criminal Offending Trajectories from Adolescence to Adulthood.,"Area-level research finds higher contemporary crime rates in historically redlined communities. However, there is a lack of multilevel research assessing the relationship between living in a historically redlined area, individual patterns of criminal offending over time, and whether this relationship varies for different racial-ethnic groups. Data are from Waves I, III, IV, and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 7,843; ages 11-44), including recently digitized 1930s redlining maps from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation. Using age-based growth curve models, we estimate rates of criminal offending for non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White Americans who live inside (vs. outside) formerly redlined areas from adolescence to adulthood. Starting in adolescence, Black and Hispanic respondents typically report more criminal offenses than White peers, regardless of redlining. As respondents transition to adulthood, reports of criminal offenses approach zero at an exponential rate. However, declines in criminal offenses are lagged by two years, on average, for Black and Hispanic respondents who live in redlined areas, relative to White and non-redlined counterparts. Findings suggest formerly redlined urban areas may still promote criminal behavior, particularly for Black and Hispanic adolescents transitioning to adulthood. Future research and policy should address the long-term consequences of institutionalized segregation for public safety and community well-being.",0
40122182,Loss of excitatory inputs and decreased tonic and evoked activity of locus coeruleus neurons in aged P301S mice.,"Tau pathology in the locus coeruleus (LC) is associated with several neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Phosphorylated tau accumulates in the LC and results in inflammation, synaptic loss, and eventually cell death as the disease progresses. Loss of LC neurons and noradrenergic innervation is thought to contribute to the symptoms of cognitive decline later in disease. While loss and degeneration of LC neurons has been well studied, less is known about changes in LC physiology at advanced stages of tau pathology that precedes neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo electrophysiological properties of LC neurons in male and female mice from the P301S mouse model of tauopathy at 9 months of age, a time-point when significant tau accumulation, cell death, and cognitive impairments are observed. We found a reduction in excitatory inputs and changes in excitatory post-synaptic current kinetics in male and female P301S. There was also a decrease in spontaneous discharge of LC neurons and an increase in AP threshold in P301S mice of both sexes. Finally, we observed a decrease in excitability and increase in rheobase current in P301S mice. Despite the decrease in LC activity in ex vivo slices, we did not identify differences in total tissue norepinephrine (NE) or NE metabolites in prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. Together these findings demonstrate reductions in the activity and excitability of LC neurons at late stages of tau accumulation. However, compensatory mechanisms may maintain normal NE levels in LC projection regions in vivo.",0
40122152,Identification of Cytochrome P450 2E1 as a Novel Target in Neuroinflammation and Development of Its Inhibitor Q11 as a Treatment Strategy.,"Neuroinflammation is implicated in nearly all pathological processes of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, no medications specifically targeting neuroinflammation are clinically available, and conventional anti-inflammatory drugs exhibit limited efficacy. Here, we identified cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) as a novel therapeutic target in neuroinflammation. Elevated CYP2E1 levels were observed in hippocampal tissues of mouse and rat neuroinflammation models, as well as in LPS-stimulated primary microglia. Genetic ablation of Cyp2e1 improved spatial learning and memory in neuroinflammatory rats and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in Cyp2e1-deficient microglia. Furthermore, Q11 (1-(4-methyl-5-thiazolyl) ethenone), a novel CYP2E1 inhibitor developed and synthesized in our laboratory, effectively ameliorated Alzheimer's disease-related spatial learning and memory functions and depression-related anxiety-like behaviors in mice/rats. Mechanistically, Q11 attenuated microglial activation, neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation by suppressing the PI3K/Akt, STAT1/3, and NF-κB signaling pathways. These findings establish CYP2E1 as a druggable target for neuroinflammation and propose Q11 as a promising candidate for treating neuroinflammation-related diseases.",0
40122134,Enhanced expression of miR-128 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells: a potent candidate diagnostic biomarker for multiple sclerosis.,"Millions of people worldwide, especially young adults, are affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating and autoimmune condition of the central nervous system (CNS). Many studies have focused on the diagnostic value of miRNAs circulating in body fluids of MS patients. Thus, this study aimed to assess the expression of miR-128 and its potential as a biomarker for MS in the Iranian population. This study recruited 85 MS patients and 30 healthy matched controls. Following the collection of blood samples, serum was isolated. RNA was then extracted, cDNA was synthesized, and miR-128 expression was measured by real-time PCR. There was significant overexpression of miR-128 in MS patients in comparison with healthy controls (p-value <0.0001). In addition, there was a rather notable association between the subtypes of MS samples and the expression levels of miR-128. ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.9111 (95%CI 0.85-0.97, p-value <0.0001) with sensitivity and specificity of 80.00% and 93.33%, respectively. The expression of miR-128 was significantly higher in PBMCs of MS patients in comparison with healthy controls. Additionally, miR-128 could be an excellent biomarker for MS patient diagnosis.",0
40122104,Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel 18F-labeled Oxadiazole-based Positron Emission Tomography Tracers for β-Amyloid.,"This research details the synthesis, structure-activity evaluation, and analysis of novel oxadiazole-based compounds for visualizing β-amyloid (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The derivatives exhibited binding affinities to Aβ aggregates in vitro. The [18F]-labeled compounds, [18F]4-(5-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N, N-dimethylaniline (compound [18F] 3) and [18F] 4-(5-(4-Fluorophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N-methylaniline (compound [18F]4), effectively labeled Aβ plaques in brain sections from Alzheimer's disease patients and APP/PS1 mice. In dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies on healthy mice, these compounds demonstrated favorable brain uptake followed by clearance. Additional structural alterations to compounds [18F] 3 and [18F] 4 may lead to the development of more efficient PET tracers for precise visualization of Aβ plaques.",0
40122087,"Three decades of population health changes in Japan, 1990-2021: a subnational analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.","Given Japan's rapidly ageing demographic structure, comprehensive and long-term evaluations of its national and subnational health progress are important to inform public health policy. This study aims to assess Japan's population health, using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to analyse the country's evolving disease patterns. GBD 2021 used Japanese data from 1474 sources, covering 371 diseases, including COVID-19, and 88 risk factors. The analysis included estimates of life expectancy, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates were generated using the standardised GBD methodology, which incorporates various data sources through statistical modelling, including the Cause Of Death Ensemble Model for mortality, Bayesian Meta-Regression Disease Model for non-fatal outcomes, and risk factor estimation frameworks to quantify attributable burdens. Life expectancy decomposition by cause of death and annualised rates of change of age-standardised mortality and DALYs were calculated for 1990-2005, 2005-15, and 2015-21. Between 1990 and 2021, life expectancy in Japan rose from 79·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 79·3-79·4) to 85·2 years (85·1-85·2), with prefecture-level disparities widening. Gains were primarily driven by reduced mortality from stroke (adding 1·5 years to life expectancy), ischaemic heart disease (1·0 years), and neoplasms, particularly stomach cancer (0·5 years), with variation across prefectures. Leading causes of death in 2021 were Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (135·3 deaths [39·5-312·3] per 100 000 population), stroke (114·9 [89·8-129·3] per 100 000), ischaemic heart disease (96·5 [77·7-106·7] per 100 000), and lung cancer (72·1 [61·8-77·5] per 100 000). Age-standardised mortality for major non-communicable diseases declined, but the pace of this decline has slowed. All-cause annualised rate of change in mortality rate decreased from -1·6% for 2005-15 to -1·1% for 2015-21. Age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates were 0·8 deaths (0·7-0·9) per 100 000 population (accounting for 0·3% of all deaths) in 2020 and 3·0 (2·5-3·7) per 100 000 population in 2021 (1·0% of deaths). Age-standardised DALY rates for diabetes worsened, with annualised rate of change increasing from 0·1% for 2005-15 to 2·2% for 2015-21. This change parallels worsening trends in major risk factors, particularly high fasting plasma glucose (annualised rate of change of attributable DALYs -0·8% for 2005-15 and 0·8% for 2015-21) and high BMI (0·2% and 1·4%, respectively). Age-standardised DALYs attributable to other major risk factors continued to decrease, albeit slower. Japan's health gains over the past 30 years are now stalling, with rising regional disparities. The increasing burdens of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and diabetes, alongside high fasting plasma glucose and high BMI, highlight areas needing focused attention and action.

40122070,A patent review of CXCR7 modulators (2019-present).,"Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) (formerly CXCR7) regulates various biological processes through its ligands and is closely associated with numerous diseases, including inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), pain, and neurological disorders. Therefore, ACKR3 has emerged as a potential target for disease treatment. This review summarizes the ACKR3 modulators published in patents from 2019 to 2024 using data from Google Patents, the European Patent Office, and the World Intellectual Property Organization's online databases. This includes information on their chemical structures, syntheses, activities, and developmental stages. ACKR3 agonists gained traction as a treatment for cardiovascular and pain conditions. WW-12, which was derived from the chemical modifications of conolidine, became a novel small-molecule pain modulator by activating ACKR3, which in turn boosted endogenous opioid peptides for the classical opioid receptors.ACKR3 antagonist ACT-1004-1239 from Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. has demonstrated the ability to treat cancer, acute lung injury/ARDS, and autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. The outcomes of these clinical trials will direct the development and indications of future ACKR3 modulators.",0
40122041,Biopsychosocial Factors and Pain Hypervigilance should be considered in the Interpretation of Disease Activity in Systemic Sclerosis.,"This study aimed to identify a pain phenotype associated with hypervigilance in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and to evaluate possible variables that influence pain hypervigilance symptoms. This cross-sectional, observational study included healthy controls (HCs) and SSc patients diagnosed with a score of 9 or higher according to the 2013 American College of Rheumatology-European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria. The pain hypervigilance symptoms were evaluated using the CS Inventory (CSI) questionnaire, while disease activity was assessed using the European Scleroderma Research Group Activity Index (EScSG-AI). The patients were classified based on CSI scores. Comparative analyses were conducted for clinical, sociodemographic, and biopsychosocial factors. 51 SSc patients (92.2% female, mean age 50.54±13.16 years) and 45 HCs (88.9% female, mean age 52.62±10.4 years) were included. Education and monthly income were lower for SSc than HCs (p<0.05). The CSI score≥40 proportion was 56.9% in SSc and 15.6% in HCs (p<0.001). Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and EuroQol Five-Dimensional Three-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) scores were higher in SSc than HCs (p<0.05). In multiple linear regression analysis to determine predictors of CSI score≥40, the effective variable was EScSG-AI. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, educational level and global PSQI scores were factors associated with CSI score≥40 in SSc. CSI score was positively associated with depression, disease activity, stress, anxiety, and poor sleep quality, and negatively associated with education and economic status. Pain hypervigilance may affect organ involvement and functioning in SSc. Clinicians should examine its biopsychosocial components.",0
40122015,Within-session dual-task walking practice improves gait variability in older adults with multiple sclerosis.,"Greater gait variability is associated with falls in aging and multiple sclerosis. However, whether older adults with MS (OAMS), show higher gait variability relative to healthy older adults (HOA), under single and dual-task walking conditions, has not been reported. Furthermore, it is unclear whether practice may improve gait variability in both groups. Is gait variability higher in OAMS relative to HOA, particularly in DTW compared to STW? Furthermore, does practice result in decreased gait variability in both groups, notably under DTW compared to STW? We examined the effect of within-session practice on gait variability during single (STW) and dual (DTW) task gait conditions. OAMS (n = 97, mean±SD age: 65 ± 5 years, 66 females) and HOA (n = 113, mean±SD age: 68 ± 7 years, 73 females) were recruited. Practice effects on gait variability were evaluated over three repeated counterbalanced STW and DTW trials. Gait variability measures included Coefficient of Variation (CV) in stride velocity, stride length, and swing time. OAMS demonstrated higher gait variability, on all measures, relative to HOA during both STW and DTW (P < 0.001). Gait variability on all measures was higher in DTW compared to STW, (P < 0.05). Practice resulted in decreased gait variability (P < 0.01) on all measures in both OAMS and HOA. Furthermore, practice resulted in decreased temporal gait variability, as measured by swing time CV, under DTW in particular (P < 0.05). In conclusion, OAMS exhibited greater gait variability than HOA, yet both groups demonstrated decreases in temporal and spatial gait variability after within-session practice, notably under DTW, which in turn may reduce fall risk.",0
40121962,Intrinsic capacity in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies compared with those with Alzheimer's disease: A cross-sectional study.,"Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual, has never been studied in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As IC decline is associated with the risk of frailty, functional decline and disability and is potentially reversible after targeted interventions, a monitoring and specific management of IC decline in patients with DLB could promote healthy aging in this population. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the frequency of IC decline in DLB and to compare it with AD. A single-center cross-sectional study. This study was carried out in a memory clinic between 2015 and 2023 based on the MEMORA cohort. Patients with a diagnosis of AD or probable DLB and a comprehensive geriatric assessment. IC was assessed according to the WHO model in 4 domains: vitality assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), locomotion assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), psychology assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale 4-items (GDS-4 items), and hearing assessed by the Hearing, Vision, Equilibrium and Cognition (HVEC) scale. A total of 798 patients (154 with probable DLB and 644 with AD) were included, and the mean age was 81.4 years (SD 6.33). Compared with AD patients, DLB patients had significantly more impaired IC in all domains, with greater risks of impaired vitality (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60-3.72), locomotion (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.15-5.90), psychology (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.73-3.92) and hearing (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.53-3.49), according to the adjusted models. Similarly, when IC domains were considered linear variables, IC across all domains was significantly lower in the DLB group than in the AD group. This study revealed that DLB patients presented a greater decrease in IC than did AD patients across all domains. In memory clinics, DLB patients could be offered systematic and early IC monitoring and personalized interventions.",0
40121956,Efficient strategy for alleviating neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress damage of Alzheimer's disease through dual targeting BCL-2 gene promoter i-motif and β-amyloid.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal metabolism of β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor proteins and neuronal apoptosis, ultimately leading to cognitive dysfunction. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and current single-target therapies are not effective in preventing the rapid progression of AD, which highlights the urgent need for developing multi-target drugs. In this study, a series of compounds were synthesized through a multi-targeting ligand strategy. After extensive screening and evaluation, we found a lead compound B14, which showed excellent dual targeting ability for effectively alleviating neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress damage of AD. In our molecular and cellular level experiments, B14 could target and stabilize the i-motif structure formed on the BCL-2 promoter to upregulate BCL-2 expression, which could also bind to Aβ and inhibit its deposition. In the Aβ",0
40121822,Altered cerebellar activation patterns in Alzheimer's disease: An activation likelihood estimation Meta-Analysis.,"The past decade has seen an increased interest in the cerebellum, particularly in non-motor behaviors. Emerging work across model systems and in humans has also implicated the cerebellum in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While the cerebellum is not seen as being central to the etiology of the disease, it is however recognized as being increasingly important, and most certainly not immune from disease-related pathology and atrophy. In cognitively normal older adults (OA), the cerebellum has been conceptualized as being critical scaffolding for cortical function. This scaffolding may extend to AD and MCI. With respect to functional imaging, this is largely unexplored in AD, as this is a nascent literature. While there are very few studies focused on the cerebellum in AD at this stage, meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for expanding our knowledge of the cerebellum in neurodegenerative disease, and, in turn, for hypothesis generation. We took advantage of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to investigate overlap in functional activation present in the existing literature. We focused on AD, but also included an exploratory analysis of MCI, based on papers available in our AD search. Our analysis included a total of 29 studies, representing data from 236 individuals with AD, 159 with MCI, and 382 OA. Across these studies, there is no significant overlap in cerebellar activation in AD, though this is present in MCI. Analyses of group differences also suggest that across studies, there are patterns indicative of both greater and reduced activation in AD/MCI relative to OA. Across all findings, overlap was primarily centered on Crus I and Lobule VI. These findings suggest that cerebellar function is negatively impacted in AD, which in turn may impact behavior and symptomatology.",0
40121742,Understanding the pleiotropic effects of CXCL10/IP-10 in the immunopathogenesis of inflammatory rheumatic diseases: Implications for better understanding disease mechanisms.,"Chemokines play a critical role in immune responses, acting as chemotactic factors and effectors in different immune processes. CXCL10/IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) is an inflammatory chemokine that regulates immune cell activation and recruitment by binding to its receptor CXCR3. Additionally, CXCL10 inhibits angiogenesis by interacting with endothelial cells (ECs). In the context of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, CXCL10 influences multiple pathways including chemotaxis, angiostasis, bone destruction, joint inflammation, and regulation of fibroblast-like synoviocyte properties. High levels of CXCL10 have been detected in the serum and tissues of individuals with autoimmune conditions like systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and among others (ankylosing spondylitis, Behçet's syndrome). The CXCL10 may inhibit fibroblast recruitment after tissue injury, delaying wound healing; inhibiting angiogenesis, and uncontrolled pulmonary fibrosis in SSc. In RA disease, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could increase the inflammatory cell infiltration, including T lymphocytes and macrophages, into inflamed joints, enhancing arthritis severity and bone and cartilage destruction.

40121723,"Long-term nucleus basalis cholinergic lesions alter the structure of cortical vasculature, astrocytic density and microglial activity in Wistar rats.","Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are the sole source of cholinergic innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in humans and the primary source in rodents. This system undergoes early degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. BFCNs terminal synapses are involved in the regulation of the cerebral blood flow by making classical synaptic contacts with other neurons. Additionally, they are located in proximity to cortical cerebral blood vessels, forming connections with various cell types of the neurovascular unit (NVU), including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytic end-feet. However, the effects of the BFCNs input on NVU components remain unresolved. To address this issue, we immunolesioned the nucleus basalis by administering bilateral stereotaxic injections of the cholinergic immunotoxin 192-IgG-Saporin in 2.5-month-old Wistar rats. Seven months post-lesion, we observed a significant reduction in cortical vesicular acetylcholine transporter-immunoreactive synapses. This was accompanied by changes in the diameter of cortical capillaries and precapillary arterioles, as well as lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Additionally, the cholinergic immunolesion increased the density of cortical astrocytes and microglia in the cortex. At these post-BFCN-lesion stages, astrocytic end-feet exhibited an increased co-localization with arterioles. The number of microglia in the parietal cortex correlated with cholinergic loss and exhibited morphological changes indicative of an intermediate activation state. This was supported by decreased levels of proinflammatory mediators IFN-γ, IL-1β, and KC/GRO (CXCL1), and by increased expression of M2 markers SOCS3, IL4Rα, YM1, ARG1, and Fizz1. Our findings offer a novel insight: that the loss of nucleus basalis cholinergic input negatively impacts cortical blood vessels, NVU components, and microglia phenotype.",0
40121699,Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody positive patients -validation of current diagnostic criteria.,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in the 2023 MOGAD International Panel diagnostic criteria help distinguish myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disease (MOGAD) from mimics, particularly when MOG antibody titers are low. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of these MRI features in a large, previously diagnosed cohort. All MOG IgG cell-based assays performed by Mitogen Dx laboratory in Alberta from July 2017 to July 2023 were retrieved. All MOG positive with a MOGAD presentation and => one MRI study of brain, spine, or optic nerves were identified. MRIs were re-evaluated by two neuroradiologists and a neurologist for MOGAD-like features. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and positive and negative predictive value were calculated based on diagnosis in all patients and low antibody titer patients specifically. Of 3831 tested patients, 158 had MOG antibodies, a MOGAD-consistent presentation, and MRI(s) of brain, spine or optic nerves. Of these 158 patients, 102 were diagnosed with MOGAD. Compared to patients with higher antibody titers, low titer patients with MOGAD MRI features had preserved specificity and improved negative predictive value for a MOGAD diagnosis. Only MOGAD patients had lesion resolution. When applying MRI features from the 2023 MOGAD diagnostic criteria to an existing cohort, there was good sensitivity and specificity for MOGAD with improved specificity and negative predictive value in those with low antibody titers. The odds of a MOGAD diagnosis were high when lesions resolved on repeated imaging, particularly versus multiple sclerosis, suggesting this feature may merit more weight in future diagnostic criteria.",0
40121491,"Accelerometer-derived ""weekend warrior"" physical activity, sedentary behavior, and risk of dementia.","Research has shown that sedentary behavior (SB) may increase dementia risk, but it remains unclear whether concentrated moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) can compensate such negative effects. This study aimed to explore the association between different MVPA patterns combined with SB time and the risk of dementia. This prospective study used data from the UK Biobank cohort, which provided accelerometer-based physical activity data for a full week from February 2013 to December 2015. Participants were categorized into ""weekend warriors (WW)"" group, engaged in more than 50% MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) on 1 to 2 days; inactive group (total MVPA < 150 min/week); and regular group, who met the recommended MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) but not WW. The participants were further divided into six groups based on SB duration (≥ 8.52 h/day or < 8.52 h/day). A multivariable Cox model was used to assess the relationship between these patterns and the risk of dementia, adjusted by age, gender, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, education level, employment status, alcohol consumption, smoking, BMI, and baseline comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes). We included 91,948 participants without dementia at baseline. During a median follow-up of 7.93 years, 736 participants developed all-cause dementia. When the MVPA threshold was set at 150 min per week, 16,149 participants (17.5%) were classified as WW with long SB, 19,055 (20.7%) as regular with long SB, and 21,909 (23.8%) as inactive with long SB. Compared to inactive and long SB time, the WW group showed a reduction in dementia risk (WW with long SB time: HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.87, P = 0.002; WW with short SB time: HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.97, P = 0.029). And regular group with shorter SB time was associated with a lower dementia risk (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.96, P = 0.021), but not in the group with longer SB time. The WW pattern may help mitigate the dementia risk associated with prolonged SB, suggesting that the quality and intensity of physical activity are also important factors.",0
40121258,Effect of PHF-1 hyperphosphorylation on the seeding activity of C-terminal Tau fragments.,"Tau proteins as neurofibrillary tangles are one of the molecular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and play a central role in tauopathies, a group of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. The filament cores from diverse tauopathies share a common region of tau consisting of the R3-R4 microtubule-binding repeats and part of the C-terminal domain, but present a structural polymorphism. Unlike the fibril structure, the PTM signature of tau found in neuronal inclusions, more particularly hyperphosphorylation, is variable between individuals with the same tauopathy, giving rise to diverse strains with different seeding properties that could modulate the aggressiveness of tau pathology. Here, we investigate the conformation, function and seeding activity of two tau fragments and their GSK3β-phosphorylated variants. The R2Ct and R3Ct fragments encompass the aggregation-prone region of tau starting at the R2 and R3 repeats, respectively, and the full C-terminal domain including the PHF-1 epitope (S396, S400, S404), which undergoes a triple phosphorylation upon GSK3β activity. We found that the R3Ct fragment shows both a greater loss of function and pathological activity in seeding of aggregation than the R2Ct fragment which imposes a cross-seeding barrier. PHF-1 hyperphosphorylation induces a local conformational change with a propensity to adopt a β-sheet conformation in the region spanning residues 392-402, and exacerbates the seeding ability of fragments to induce aggregation by overcoming a cross-seeding barrier between tau variants.",0
40121230,Radial glia integrin avb8 regulates cell autonomous microglial TGFβ1 signaling that is necessary for microglial identity.,"Microglial diversity arises from the interplay between inherent genetic programs and external environmental signals. However, the mechanisms by which these processes develop and interact within the growing brain are not yet fully understood. Here, we show that radial glia-expressed integrin beta 8 (ITGB8) activates microglia-expressed TGFβ1 to drive microglial development. Domain-restricted deletion of Itgb8 in these progenitors results in regionally restricted and developmentally arrested microglia that persist into adulthood. In the absence of autocrine TGFβ1 signaling, microglia adopt a similar phenotype, leading to neuromotor symptoms almost identical to Itgb8 mutant mice. In contrast, microglia lacking the canonical TGFβ signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3 have a less polarized dysmature phenotype and correspondingly less severe neuromotor dysfunction. Our study describes the spatio-temporal regulation of TGFβ activation and signaling in the brain necessary to promote microglial development, and provides evidence for the adoption of microglial developmental signaling pathways in brain injury or disease.",0
40121201,Brain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations are associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.,"5-hydroxymethylcytosine, also known as the sixth DNA base of the genome, plays an important role in brain aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about its genome-wide distribution and its association with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we report a genome-wide profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in 1079 autopsied brains (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) of older individuals and assess its association with multiple measures of Alzheimer's disease pathologies, including pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β load, and PHFtau tangle density. Of 197,765 5-hydroxymethylcytosine regions detected, we identified 2821 differentially hydroxymethylated regions associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology after controlling for multiple testing and covariates. Many differentially hydroxymethylated regions are located within known Alzheimer's disease loci, such as RIN3, PLCG2, ITGA2B, and USP6NL. Integrative multi-omics analyses support a potential mechanistic role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations in Alzheimer's disease. Our study presents a large-scale genome-wide atlas of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in Alzheimer's brain and offers insight into the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",0
40121165,Phenotypic alterations in peripheral blood B Lymphocytes of patients with Alzheimer's Disease.,"Dysfunction of humoral immunity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The distribution of B lymphocyte subsets and their clinical relevance in AD remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the distribution of peripheral blood B lymphocyte subsets and their relevance with cognition and biomarkers in AD. We evaluated the immunophenotype of peripheral B lymphocytes in 27 AD patients confirmed by PET-Amyloid scan and 32 cognitively normal controls. The phenotype of B lymphocytes is altered in AD patients. AD patients exhibit a decrease in both the numbers and proportions of switched memory (SwM) B cells and double-negative (DN) B cells. The proportion of unswitched memory (USwM) B cells was increased after in vitro stimulation. Additionally, B cells that produce proinflammatory cytokines including GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and TNF-α are increased, while those that produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are decreased in AD patients after in vitro stimulation. These alterations in B cell populations were linked to cognitive functions and biomarkers, including Aβ42/40 and pTau181, in AD patients. This study reveals an altered B-lymphocyte phenotype in AD patients, marked by functional and compositional dysregulation. Further research incorporating mechanistic, longitudinal, and functional studies is needed to determine whether these immune perturbations directly contribute to AD pathogenesis or arise as secondary effects of neurodegeneration.",0
40121009,Psychiatric morbidity in people with autoimmune arthritides as a model of inflammatory mechanisms in mental disorders.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) are autoimmune illnesses characterised by chronic inflammation demonstrating differential associations with psychiatric conditions. In this matched-cohort study, we aimed to investigate whether the associations between these inflammatory illnesses and mental disorders are predominantly the consequence of the burden of the former or whether common causes might underpin the susceptibility to both. Using Czech national inpatient care data, we identified individuals with RA or axSpA during the years 1999-2012. We investigated the occurrence of psychiatric outcomes up to 2017 using stratified Cox proportional hazards models. In evidence triangulation, we assessed the potential moderation by age at inflammatory illness, the associations relative to counterparts with other similarly burdensome chronic illnesses and the temporal ordering of conditions. Both RA and axSpA were associated with mood and anxiety disorders and behavioural syndromes. In evidence triangulation, the associations with depression showed a decreasing age-at-inflammatory-illness gradient in RA; the association between RA and depression was stronger than that between other chronic illnesses and depression; and excluding prevalent depression attenuated the RA-depression association. RA showed consistent inverse associations with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Common aetiologies might be involved in increasing the risk of developing both RA and depression. The consistent inverse associations between RA and schizophrenia and between RA and Alzheimer's disease suggest that at least part of these associations might also be a consequence of shared aetiologies as well as potential medication effects. People with autoimmune arthritides are more likely to experience mood and anxiety disorders, even relative to counterparts with other similarly burdensome chronic illnesses.",0
40120948,Impact of Diet and Exercise on Mitochondrial Quality and Mitophagy in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau, synaptic damage, and mitochondrial abnormalities in the brain, leading to the progressive loss of cognitive function and memory. In AD, emerging research suggests that lifestyle factors such as a healthy diet and regular exercise may play a significant role in delaying the onset and progression of the disease. Mitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, as they are responsible for producing the energy to cells, including neurons to maintain cognitive function. Our article elaborates on how mitochondrial quality and function decline with age and AD, leading to an increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in ATP production. Decline in mitochondrial quality can impair cellular functions contributing to the development and progression of disease with the loss of neuronal functions in AD. This article also covered mitophagy, the process by which damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria are selectively removed from the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis. Impaired mitophagy has been implicated in the progression and pathogenesis of AD. We also discussed the impact of impaired mitophagy implicated in AD, as the accumulation of damaged mitochondria can lead to increased oxidative stress. We expounded how dietary interventions and exercise can help to improve mitochondrial quality, and mitochondrial function and enhance mitophagy in AD. A diet rich in antioxidants, polyphenols, and mitochondria-targeted molecules has been shown to enhance mitochondrial function and protect against oxidative stress, particularly in neurons with aged and mild cognitively impaired subjects and AD patients. Promoting a healthy lifestyle, mainly balanced diet and regular exercise that support mitochondrial health, in an individual can potentially delay the onset and progression of AD. In conclusion, a healthy diet and regular exercise play a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial quality and mitochondrial function, in turn, enhancing mitophagy and synaptic activities that delay AD in the elderly.",0
40120943,Differences in brain function entropy due to cognitive impairment: Application of functional near infrared spectroscopy measures during dual-tasking.,"Screening guidelines for cognitive impairment are subjective and inconsistent, often leading to delayed diagnoses. An objective, simple method is needed. Dual-tasking, combined with brain function measurements, may provide sufficient cognitive cost to differentiate between healthy and cognitively impaired populations. It was hypothesized that low complexity (entropy) of brain activity is associated with cognitive impairment, and that dual-tasking would better differentiate between healthy and cognitively impaired groups over resting. Eighty-three participants were recruited: healthy young adults (HY; MoCA = 27.82 ± 1.63, age = 21.13 ± 2.36), cognitively normal older adults (CN; MoCA = 26.59 ± 1.92, age = 75.89 ± 6.93), and mild cognitively impaired/early-stage Alzheimer's disease older adults (MCI/AD; MoCA =18.96 ± 5.69, age = 78.62 ± 8.54). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measured brain activity during a rest and dual-task involving flexion and serial subtraction. The area under the curve (AUC) of multiple scale entropy outcomes was averaged by functional brain regions: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), front eye fields, motor, visuomotor, and primary sensory. During dual-tasking, the average AUC values across all fNIRS channels were 75.02 ± 12.51, 61.44 ± 14.60 and 42.26 ± 22.89 for HY, CN, and MCI/AD groups, respectively. During dual-tasking, differences between AUC values of CN and MCI/AD groups were significant for the average across all channels, primary sensory, aPFC, and dlPFC regions (p < 0.05). During rest, only the average across all channels was significantly different between CN and MCI/AD groups (p = 0.02). Findings suggest that dual-tasking may better screen for cognitive impairment using fNIRS compared to other task types, especially in regions associated with pathological and behavioral changes in AD.",0
40120784,GSK-3β dysregulation in aging: Implications for tau pathology and Alzheimer's disease progression.,"The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for linking amyloid-beta (Aβ) and Tau pathology. The activity of GSK-3β is dysregulated in the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and production of Aβ by modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. This review discusses the mechanisms controlling GSK-3β dysregulation in aging and its influence on AD progression, focusing on the role of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and defective signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and Wnt. Critical analysis is presented for therapeutic strategies targeting GSK-3β using natural compounds (e.g., curcumin, geniposide) and emerging approaches such as TREM2 modulation and miRNA therapies. In preclinical models, these interventions promise to reduce Tau hyperphosphorylation and Aβ burden, along with associated neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, achieving selective GSK-3β inhibition and optimizing drug delivery are still critical barriers to clinical translation. This review underscores the central role of GSK-3β in AD pathogenesis to highlight its potential as a multifaceted therapeutic target of an innovative strategy for treating this complex neurodegenerative disease.",0
40120783,Fibrillar amyloidosis and synaptic vesicle protein expression progress jointly in the cortex of a mouse model with β-amyloid pathology.,"Neurodegeneration, accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, and neuroinflammation are the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial association between synaptic activity, Aβ plaque load, and neuroinflammation in an Aβ mouse model with limited neurodegeneration. 26 APPSL70 and 15 C57Bl/6 mice underwent longitudinal PET-scans with [",0
40120777,A red lentils-based synbiotic cookie exerts neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"Gut microbiota preservation or rational manipulation is a key condition for healthy longevity and a promising strategy to prevent neurodegenerations exploiting the gut-brain axis, with a key role of prebiotics and probiotics. Whether their combination in a functional food can provide a synergistic effect to the host remains controversial. To fill this gap, we supplemented the diet of 3xTg-AD Alzheimer's disease mice with a red lentils (prebiotic)-based cookie enriched with neuroprotective probiotics and we performed behavioural, biochemical and molecular tests. Chronic consumption of this synbiotic preparation (functional cookie) preserved cognition, reduced amyloid load, improved glucose and lipid homeostasis and diminished oxidation and inflammation related damages compared to animals receiving a classic cookie (standard recipe). The synergistic effect was indicated by significantly higher glucose insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations in the functional cookie group compared to probiotic group. Moreover, Ruminoclostridium sp KB18 and Ruminicoccus decreased in the gut of mice supplemented with the functional cookie, partially explaining the improved short-term memory upon treatments and substantiating the combined use over individual components. This synbiotic innovative snack represents a prototype of a simple and affordable dietary approach to promote healthy aging and prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerations.",0
40120713,Refining the interactions between microglia and astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease pathology.,"Microglia and astrocytes are central to the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), working both independently and collaboratively to regulate key pathological processes such as β-amyloid protein (Aβ) deposition, tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, and synapse loss. These glial cells interact through complex molecular pathways, including IL-3/IL-3Ra and C3/C3aR, which influence disease progression and cognitive decline. Emerging research suggests that modulating these pathways could offer therapeutic benefits. For instance, recombinant IL-3 administration in mice reduced Aβ plaques and improved cognitive functions, while C3aR inhibition alleviated Aβ and tau pathologies, restored synaptic function, and corrected immune dysregulation. However, the effects of these interactions are context-dependent. Acute C3/C3aR activation enhances microglial Aβ clearance, whereas chronic activation impairs it, highlighting the dual roles of glial signaling in AD. Furthermore, C3/C3aR signaling not only impacts Aβ clearance but also modulates tau pathology and synaptic integrity. Given AD's multifactorial nature, understanding the specific pathological environment is crucial when investigating glial cell contributions. The interplay between microglia and astrocytes can be both neuroprotective and neurotoxic, depending on the disease stage and brain region. This complexity underscores the need for targeted therapies that modulate glial cell activity in a context-specific manner. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying microglia-astrocyte interactions, this research advances our understanding of AD and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and related disorders.",0
40120708,Advancing Alzheimer's disease therapy through engineered exosomal Macromolecules.,"Exosomes are a subject of continuous investigation due to their function as extracellular vesicles (EVs) that significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders (NDD), including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exosomes have shown the potential to carry both therapeutic and pathogenic materials; hence, researchers have used exosomes for medication delivery applications. Exosomes have reduced immunogenicity when used as natural drug delivery vehicles. This guarantees the efficient delivery of the medication without causing significant side reactions. Exosomes have lately enabled the potential for drug delivery in AD, along with promising future therapeutic uses for the detection of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, exosomes have been examined for their prospective use in illness diagnosis and prediction before the manifestation of symptoms. This review will document prior studies and will concentrate on the rationale behind the substantial potential of exosomes in the treatment of AD and their prospective use as a diagnostic and predictive tool for this condition.",0
40120662,Promotion of remyelination by a thyromimetic drug leading to functional recovery.,"Promotion of remyelination has become a critical therapeutic approach in the treatment of demyelinating disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), both to restore function and protect intact axons against future degeneration. Thyroid hormone receptor agonist mediated signaling is critical for the maturation of oligodendrocytes (Ols) from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and may be a rational target for drug development in the treatment of MS. Therefore, we tested the potential of a thyromimetic drug pro-drug, LL-341070, to promote remyelination and neurologic recovery in a unique large animal model in which there is extensive demyelination throughout the CNS that results from the prolonged feeding of irradiated food. In four out of eight cats fed the irradiated diet that had developed significant neurologic dysfunction, daily treatment with LL-341070 led to clinical improvement or complete recovery of baseline function. Extensive evidence of remyelination was observed throughout the brain, spinal cord and in the optic nerve in these four animals when compared with non- treated animals. These results provide support for thyroid hormone receptor agonism as a potential novel target to promote remyelination and clinical outcomes in patients with MS.",0
40120660,Impact of long-term deltamethrin exposure on Alzheimer's-related neurodegeneration in rats.,"In recent years, epidemiological studies have emerged indicating a potential association between chronic exposure to pesticides and the development of chronic neurodegenerative nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of long-term nonfatal exposure to Deltamethrin in spreading this disease. To this end, a range of aspects of brain damage were discussed in rats administered deltamethrin in oral doses of 0.65 mg/kg b.w. and 1.3 mg/kg b.w. for 30 days. The activation of beta-amyloid, the primary component of plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, and the NG2, a type 1 transmembrane protein, was assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot methods in rat brain. In addition, the expression level of the APP, GFAP, NfL, TNF-alpha, CXCL9, CCL5, and IL-1 alpha genes in deltamethrin-exposed brain tissue was measured using qRT-PCR. In addition, levels of pTau181 and Abeta42 were measured with ELISA. A strong positive immunohistochemical reaction for beta-amyloid was detected in the deltamethrin-exposed brain tissues. A decrease in NG2 immunofluorescence positivity was found in the application groups compared to the control group. It was demonstrated that deltamethrin exposure significantly up-regulated the expressions of APP, GFAP, NfL, TNF-alpha, CXCL9, CCL5, and IL-1 alpha genes, also significantly higher the levels of pTau181 and Abeta42 (pg/mL) in rat brain tissues. This study provides scientific evidence that exposure to chronic doses of deltamethrin may play a positive role in the development of diseases such as Alzheimer's. Future studies should investigate similar projects and expand knowledge on the topic.",0
40120619,Multiple sclerosis and COVID-19: interactions and unresolved issues.,"Serious symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 complications are particular concerns for people with multiple sclerosis, especially those receiving immunosuppressants or immunomodulators. Studies have aimed to identify individuals with multiple sclerosis who are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, to analyse the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and multiple sclerosis and to evaluate immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccines. The emergence of evolving dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, a range of available vaccines, and novel therapeutic approaches requires that clinical neurologists be regularly updated with the latest information. Unresolved issues include optimisation of vaccination strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy and the management of patients who do not show seroconversion post vaccination. Tailored vaccination has the potential to improve patient care, and future studies should focus on evaluating novel therapies and preventive measures while constantly updating our knowledge of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants, in preparation for future outbreaks or pandemics.",0
40120496,"The potential capacities of FTY720: Novel therapeutic functions, targets, and mechanisms against diseases.","Fingolimod (FTY720), an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), functions by binding to S1P receptors (S1PRs), excluding S1PR2. It received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2010. As the first non-selective oral agonist for S1PRs, FTY720's diverse and systemic receptor expression often leads to alterations in various signaling pathways and multiple systems, making it a subject of intense research. Recent studies have identified a wide range of novel or potential functions for FTY720 beyond its application in MS. These include effects on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), vascular system, organelles, and cell death, as well as potential applications in organ transplantation, immune disorders, oncological conditions, neurological and psychiatric disorders, viral infections, and hypersensitivity diseases. This paper reviews the novel roles, targets, and mechanisms of FTY720 that hold promise for clinical utility. Additionally, it summarizes FTY720's derivation and development process, the characterization and mechanism of the structure of FTY720-P bound to S1PRs, the clinical safety profile, future challenges, and potential strategies to address them. These insights aim to guide future research and applications of FTY720, maximizing its therapeutic potential.",0
40120485,Illustrate the metabolic regulatory effects of Ganoderma Lucidum polysaccharides on cognitive dysfunction in formaldehyde-exposed mouse brain by mass spectrometry imaging.,"Long-term formaldehyde (FA) exposure causes cognitive dysfunction, often associated with metabolic disorders. While some studies suggest Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) can improve cognitive function, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the effects of GLP on FA-exposed cognitive dysfunction and the regulation of GLP on brain metabolic disturbances caused by FA remain unclear. In our study, we revealed that GLP significantly reversed FA-exposed spatial cognitive deficits in mice by using Morris Water Maze and Histological analysis. Furthermore, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) found that exposure of FA can caused dysregulated expression of 35 metabolites. Following GLP treatment, there was a significant restoration of the imbalance of choline and acetylcholine, carnitine and acetylcarnitine, and spermidine and spermine, which were all involved in choline metabolism, carnitine metabolism, and polyamine metabolism. Our results suggested that GLP alleviated FA-exposed cognitive dysfunction, likely through modulation of metabolic pathways, providing a potential therapeutic approach for FA-related cognitive dysfunction.",0
40120343,Identification of the binding site and immunoreactivity of anti-Aβ antibody 11A1: Comparison with the toxic conformation-specific TxCo-1 antibody.,"Since the advent of anti-amyloid β (Aβ) immunotherapy, exemplified by lecanemab, the development of effective therapeutic agents with minimal side effects has become an urgent priority. Over the past two decades, a number of antibodies have been developed that target toxic Aβ species. The 11A1 antibody is one such example, and is made from E22P-Aβ9-35, which is prone to adopt a toxic conformation with a turn at positions 22/23, as an antigen. This antibody is unique in that it stains not only extracellular but also intracellular Aβ in human AD brains. To identify its recognition domain, we performed X-ray crystallography of 11A1 in complex with E22P-Aβ10-34. We found that 11A1 is a novel N-terminal antibody that recognizes Tyr10-His14 of Aβ. Immunohistochemical studies showed that 11A1 stains senile plaques and vascular Aβ aggregates in brain samples of AD patients. On the other hand, 11A1 recognized Aβ aggregates in neurons, astrocytes, perivascular tissue, and microvesicles of non-AD patients, suggesting that 11A1 can detect a wide range of Aβ types regardless of AD pathology. In contrast, the recently developed TxCo-1 antibody, which specifically recognizes the toxic turn at positions 22/23 of Aβ42, stained only senile plaques and vascular Aβ aggregates from AD patients, but not Aβ species from non-AD patients. These results suggest that the toxic turn structure may be one of the key epitopes for achieving high affinity for pathological Aβ aggregates while minimizing nonspecific binding to aggregates unrelated to pathology.",0
40120235,Plasma levels of the neuron damage markers brain-derived tau and glial fibrillary acidic protein in Lyme neuroborreliosis: A longitudinal study.,"A reliable blood biomarker for neuroborreliosis (NB) has yet to be identified. This study investigated levels of neuron damage markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and brain-derived tau (BD-tau) over six months of follow-up in patients with NB. The aim was to evaluate the potential of these biomarkers for monitoring treatment response and prognostic purposes. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study including plasma collected at diagnosis and approximately three- and six-months post diagnosis from adult NB patients enrolled at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet between 2018 and 2020. BD-tau concentrations were measured in-house using the Single Molecule Array (Simoa) HD-X platform, while GFAP concentrations were assessed on the same platform utilizing the GFAP Discovery Kit. Changes in biomarker concentrations were analyzed using linear mixed models with an unstructured covariance pattern, with follow-up included as a categorical fixed effect. A total of 23 patients (median age: 63 years; male/female ratio: 16/7) with 56 plasma samples were analyzed; 12 patients had complete samples. GFAP and BD-tau levels showed minimal variation throughout the study period. Patients with persistent symptoms had GFAP concentrations that were 55 % higher at diagnosis compared to those who fully recovered, though this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). No significant associations were observed between biomarker levels and treatment response or long-term outcomes. This longitudinal study did not find BD-tau or GFAP to be effective blood biomarkers for monitoring treatment response or predicting outcomes in NB.",0
40120160,Radiologically isolated syndrome: A 6-year follow-up study in Chile.,"Radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) is defined as white matter lesions fulfilling DIS criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) in individuals without MS signs and symptoms. Disease-modifying therapy (DMT) may reduce the probability of developing clinically definite MS in high-risk individuals, as recently shown in two phase 3 studies including patients from Europe and the United States. To describe the frequency and long-term outcomes of patients with RIS. Observational, longitudinal retrospective and prospective study in patients with an MS spectrum phenotype receiving regular clinical care at an MS referral centre in Chile. Magnetic Resonance (MR) and clinical visits were performed every 6 months or in the event of a suspected relapse. We assessed the characterization of patients who developed a clinical event, new asymptomatic MRI lesions or remained with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). DMT outcomes were also evaluated as exploratory analysis, including No Evidence of Disease Activity 3 (NEDA3) and Progression Independent of Disease Activity (PIRA). Out of 848 subjects, we identified 28 asymptomatic patients with MR findings consistent with RIS (3.3 %), with a median follow-up of 72 months (range 1-157). The cohort was 82 % female, with a median age at RIS diagnosis of 34 years (range 20-54), and 13 % had a family history of MS. Clinical conversion occurred in 25 % (7/28) of patients, with 71 % developing relapsing-remitting MS and 29 % developing primary-progressive MS, in a median of 21 months. The median time to the first attack was 15 months (range 3-38) for relapsing-remitting MS patients, while the median time to primary-progressive MS diagnosis was 104 months (range 50-157). Asymptomatic new lesions were observed in 57 % (16/28) of patients, with a median time of 26 months. NEDA3 was achieved in 67 % of patients who started DMT after developing a new asymptomatic lesion, compared to 43 % of those who started after clinical conversion. RIS is an infrequent diagnosis, but early treatment during the prodromal asymptomatic phase appears to be associated with improved outcomes.",0
40120159,The effects of online pilates training on cognitive functions and dual task performance in people with multiple sclerosis: A randomized controlled study.,"Cognitive impairments in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) are common and aggravate dual-task (DT) performance. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of online Pilates training on cognitive functions and the DT performance of balance, walking, and functional mobility in PwMS. In this randomized controlled trial, forty-six PwMS were recruited and randomly allocated into two groups. The Online Pilates group (OPG) received Pilates training via videoconferences three days per week during six weeks at home. The control group (CG) was a waitlist with no Pilates treatment. Cognitive Functions were assessed with Montreal Cognitive Asssessment (MoCA), The Trail Making Test (TMT), and The Stroop Test (ST). DT performance was assessed with mental tracking and verbal fluency during postural stability (PS), walking, and functional mobility. At the end of six weeks, the interaction effects (time × group) revealed significant differences for MoCA (p = 0.024), TMT-B (p = 0.012), ST (p ≤ 0.012), PS-with mental tracking (p = 0.004), PS-with verbal fluency (p = 0.003), cadence-with mental tracking (p = 0.048), and functional mobility-with mental tracking (p = 0.043) in favor of the OPG. Additionally, MoCA, TMT, ST, and DT performance during balance and functional mobility significantly improved in after six-week online Pilates training, but did not in CG. Pilates training via videoconference was effective in the improvement of cognitive functions and DT performance in PwMS. Online Pilates may be considered for improving cognitive impairments and DT performances in PwMS with barriers to accessing clinics. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06462339.",0
40120042,The HDL-Mimetic Peptide 4F Mitigates Vascular and Cortical Amyloid Pathology and Associated Neuroinflammation in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Despite recent advances, more effective and safer treatment options for AD are needed. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is one of the key pathological hallmarks of AD characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the cerebral vasculature and is associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. CAA is also considered to underlie the main adverse effect of recently FDA-approved anti-Aβ immunotherapies, namely the amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Substantial evidence has shown that elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its main protein component, APOA-I, are associated with reduced CAA and superior cognitive function. 4F is an APOA-I/HDL-mimetic peptide and its clinical safety and activity have been demonstrated in human trials for cardiovascular diseases. The present study investigates whether treatment with 4F modulates CAA and associated cognitive deficits and neuropathologies in the well-established Tg-SwDI mouse model of CAA/AD. Age/sex-matched Tg-SwDI mice received daily treatments of 4F or vehicle (PBS), respectively, by intraperitoneal injections for 12 weeks. The results showed that 4F treatment reduced overall Aβ plaque deposition and CAA, and attenuated CAA-associated microgliosis, without significantly affecting total levels of Aβ, astrocytosis, and behavioral function. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis revealed a heightened inflammatory state in the brain of SwDI mice and that 4F treatment reversed the overactivation of vascular cells, in particular vascular smooth muscle cells, relieving cerebrovascular inflammation in CAA/AD mice. Our study provides experimental evidence for the therapeutic potential of 4F to mitigate CAA and associated pathologies in AD.",0
40120039,Determining minimal clinically important differences in ecological momentary assessment measures of fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis.,"Fatigue is a common debilitating symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides a more reliable and sensitive assessment of fatigue outcomes relative to traditional recall surveys; however, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for EMA fatigue outcomes has not been established. MCIDs for EMA fatigue intensity and fatigue interference (0-10 numerical rating scale) that were assessed as outcomes in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial of three fatigue interventions were determined using two statistical approaches. The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) were used within the anchor-based approach, and standard deviations (SD) and standard error of measurements (SEM) were examined within the distribution-based approach. Pre- and post-treatment EMA data from 336 individuals with MS (76.2% female, 71.1% relapsing-remitting MS, mean age 48.8 (± 11.7) years, mean duration of MS 12.2 (± 9.8) years) were included in the analysis. Percent complete EMA data (4 EMAs/day) for 7 days were comparable pre- and post-treatment for fatigue intensity and for fatigue interference. Using the PGIC and MFIS anchors, change in EMA scores averaged 0.94 and 1.04 for fatigue intensity and 0.62 and 1.04 for fatigue interference, respectively. The SD and SEM for EMA fatigue intensity were 0.75 and 1.19 and for EMA fatigue interference were 0.83 and 1.30, respectively. Combining two approaches, our study contributes foundational information regarding meaningful change on EMA measures of fatigue, enabling effective use of EMA to assess fatigue treatment outcomes in a person-centered manner.",0
40119956,The role of VEGF in vascular dementia: impact of aging and cellular senescence.,"Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a critical element in vascular dementia (VD) pathogenesis and therapeutic development while remaining strongly influenced by aging processes and cellular aging mechanisms. VEGF's multiple effects comprise neuroprotective functions, its role in vascular development, and its ability to regulate brain blood flow systems, all leading to cognitive preservation. The prefrontal cortex exhibits elevated VEGF gene levels, which directly matches the advancement of cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease and VD. These patients exhibit higher VEGF levels in their CSF fluid, demonstrating that disease pathology includes multiple inseparable factors. Aging dramatically worsens VEGF regulation because endothelial dysfunction combines with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to generate adverse vascular symptoms that include atherosclerosis and stroke. Cellular senescence convolutes these processes by causing damaging inflammatory reactions alongside impaired vascular healing abilities. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from senescent cells (SCs) disrupts VEGF signaling and produces harmful consequences for both vascular health and cognitive well-being. The neuroprotective properties of VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b variants demonstrate their ability to lessen β-amyloid and tau protein toxicity. The protective mechanisms of VEGF depend heavily on VEGF expression levels and receptor functionality, both of which decrease with aging. The combination of approaches that modulate VEGF signaling and SC accumulation shows potential for designing treatments against VD. People can sustain BBB functionality over a longer period through Mediterranean diet consumption together with aerobic exercise along with developing therapies, including senolytics and senomorphics, which delay neurodegenerative progression. Future investigative efforts must improve VEGF delivery methods while studying cellular senescence mechanisms and developing advanced methods to detect SC cells. A three-dimensional healthcare approach combining VEGF-targeted treatments with anti-ageing interventions and detailed diagnostic techniques shows the potential for effective VD management to achieve better patient results.",0
40119889,Polyoxometalates bind multiple targets involved in Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by brain aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and Tau tangles. Despite extensive research, effective therapy for AD remains elusive. Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of inorganic compounds with diverse chemical structures and properties, are emerging as potential candidates for AD treatment due to their ability to target key molecular players implicated in disease pathogenesis, such as Aβ, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl acetylcholinesterase (BChE). Here, we use molecular docking to predict the binding pose and affinities of POMs to 10 top targets associated with AD. First, we validate our method by replicating experimentally known binding of POMs to Aβ (ΔG = - 9.67 kcal/mol), AChE (ΔG = - 9.39 kcal/mol) and BChE (ΔG = - 10.86 kcal/mol). Then, using this method, we show that POM can also bind β-secretase 1 (BACE1, ΔG = - 10.14 kcal/mol), presenilin 1 (PSEN1, ΔG = - 10.65 kcal/mol), presenilin 2 (PSEN2, ΔG = - 7.94 kcal/mol), Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP, ΔG = - 7.26 kcal/mol), Apolipoprotein E (APOE4, ΔG = - 10.05 kcal/mol), Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau (MAPT, ΔG = - 5.28 kcal/mol) depending on phosphorylation, and α-synuclein (SNCA, ΔG = - 7.64 kcal/mol). Through such binding, POMs offer the potential to mitigate APP cleavage, Aβ oligomer neurotoxicity, Aβ aggregation, thereby attenuating disease progression. Overall, our molecular docking study represents a powerful tool in the discovery of POM-based therapeutics for AD, facilitating the development of novel treatments for AD.",0
40119841,Causal Effects of Schooling on Memory at Older Ages in Six Low-and-Middle Income Countries: Nonparametric Evidence with Harmonized Datasets.,"Higher schooling attainment is associated with better cognitive function at older ages, but it remains unclear whether the relationship is causal. We estimated causal effects of schooling on performances on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) word-recall (memory) test at older ages in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa. We used harmonized data (n = 30,896) on older adults (≥50 years) from the World Health Organization Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. We applied an established nonparametric partial-identification approach that bounds causal effects of increasing schooling attainment at different parts of the schooling distributions under relatively weak assumptions. An additional year of schooling increased word-recall scores by between 0.01-0.13 standard deviations (SDs) in China, 0.01-0.06 SDs in Ghana, 0.02-0.09 SDs in India, 0.02-0.12 SDs in Mexico, and 0-0.07 SDs in South Africa when increasing schooling from never attended to primary. No results were obtained for Russia at this margin due to the low proportion of older adults with primary schooling or lower. At higher parts of the schooling distributions (e.g., high school or university completion) the bounds cannot statistically reject null effects. Our results indicate that increasing schooling from never attended to primary had long-lasting effects on memory decades later in life for older adults in five diverse low-and-middle-income countries.",0
40119826,The Association of Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment With Outpatient Ambulatory Care Utilization in the Community.,"Ambulatory care is critical in delivering interventions for dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from basic services to novel therapeutics. Yet, little is known regarding how community-dwelling persons with dementia/MCI interact with clinicians in outpatient ambulatory settings. We assessed associations of dementia/MCI with outpatient ambulatory evaluation and management (E&M) visits. We included 2116 community-dwelling participants in Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts, with linked fee-for-service Medicare claims. Annually from 2011 to 2019, cohort neuropsychologic evaluations classified participants as dementia, MCI, or no cognitive impairment (NCI). Across groups, we compared annual probability of visiting providers and number of E&M visits, using repeated measures logistic or generalized Poisson mixed effects models. Across 8672 person-years (PY) of follow-up, the mean age was 82 (SD 7.6) years; 77% of PYs were among females and 24% among Black participants. Controlling for demographics and comorbidity, the annual predicted probability of primary care visits was high in all groups (86%-92%). Although there were few visits with dementia-related specialists, we found a higher probability of these visits among those with dementia (15%) and MCI (17%) than NCI (12%; p = 0.009, dementia vs. NCI; p < 0.001, MCI vs. NCI). There were striking differences in visits to other medical specialties: the mean number of annual visits was 40% lower for those with dementia (p < 0.001) and 10% lower for MCI (p < 0.001) than NCI. Overall, dementia and MCI were associated with 19% (p < 0.001) and 4% (p = 0.005) fewer E&M visits, respectively, compared to NCI. Older adults with dementia and MCI interact with primary care providers regularly and are more likely to use dementia-related specialists than those with NCI. Yet, we found lower utilization of other medical specialties, without compensatory increases in primary care, leading to fewer overall E&M visits, even in MCI. Together, the findings may suggest lost opportunities to address the scope of health issues in vulnerable groups.",0

40119587,Hippocampal Astrocyte Morphology Follows an Unexpected Trajectory With Age in a Transgenic Rodent Model of Tauopathy.,"Individual protoplasmic astrocytes have very complex and diverse spongiform shapes. The morphological diversity of astrocytes is determined by the structural and functional interactions of the astrocyte with its microenvironment. When faced with pathological conditions, astrocytes reorganize their morphology. Yet, little is known about the astrocytic response in pure tauopathies and its evolution over time. Here, we aimed to investigate the consequences of a primary neuronal tau pathology on astrocyte fine morphology at three stages of the disease using the transgenic Thy-Tau22 mouse model. We first showed that hippocampal astrocytes in Thy-Tau22 mice progressively accumulate hyperphosphorylated tau with age. We then developed a pipeline of analyses, including 3D reconstruction of hippocampal tdTomato-labeled astrocytes via a PHP.eB adeno-associated virus, confocal microscopy, Imaris software morphometric analysis, and an advanced statistical analysis. During normal aging, the complexity of astrocyte morphology peaked at adulthood, then declined. In contrast, in Thy-Tau22 mice, tauopathy was associated with a simpler initial morphology, followed by the appearance of a cluster of complex cells at the most advanced stage. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering based on 10 morphological features, we were able to identify different astrocyte morphotypes whose relative proportion varies differently with age between WT and Thy-Tau22 mice. Interestingly, we revealed that a fraction of astrocytes with a complex morphology re-emerges late in tauopathy-affected animals. Our data highlight the concept of significant and reversible structural plasticity of astrocytes when faced with chronic pathological conditions.",0
40119586,"Gastrodin Alleviates Tau Pathology by Targeting the Alzheimer's Risk Gene FERMT2, Reversing the Reduction in Brain Viscoelasticity.","The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incompletely elucidated, and there is a notable deficiency in effective and safe therapeutic interventions. The influence of brain matrix viscoelasticity on the progression of AD has frequently been underestimated. It is imperative to elucidate these overlooked pathogenic factors and to innovate novel therapeutic strategies for AD. Gastrodin, a bioactive constituent derived from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Gastrodia elata, exhibits a range of pharmacological properties, notably in the enhancement of neural function. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of its action remain insufficiently elucidated. Consequently, this study seeks to examine the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of gastrodin in the context of AD, with particular emphasis on its potential influence on the viscoelastic properties of the brain matrix. This study employs a range of methodologies, including the Morris water maze test, Y-maze spontaneous alternation test, atomic force microscopy (AFM), immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, molecular docking, and Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA), to demonstrate that gastrodin mitigates tau pathology by modulating FERMT2, thereby reversing the deterioration of mechanical viscoelasticity in the brain. Gastrodin administration via gavage has been demonstrated to mitigate cognitive decline associated with AD, attenuate the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in the hippocampus and cortex, and ameliorate synaptic damage. Additionally, gastrodin was observed to counteract the reduction in brain matrix viscoelasticity in 3xTg-AD mice, as evidenced by the upregulation of extracellular matrix components pertinent to viscoelasticity, notably collagen types I and IV. Furthermore, molecular docking and CETSA revealed a strong binding affinity between gastrodin and FERMT2. Gastrodin treatment resulted in a reduction of FERMT2 fluorescence intensity, which is selectively expressed in astrocytes. Additionally, gastrodin contributed to the restoration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and modulated the expression levels of inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8). Gastrodin treatment has the potential to mitigate tau pathology, thereby enhancing learning and memory in AD mouse models. This effect may be mediated through the modulation of cerebral mechanical viscoelasticity via the mechanosensor FERMT2, which facilitates the restoration of synaptic structure and function. This process is potentially linked to the maintenance of BBB integrity and the modulation of inflammatory factor release.",0
40119567,New approach to specific Alzheimer's disease diagnosis based on plasma biomarkers in a cognitive disorder cohort.,"The validation of a combination of plasma biomarkers and demographic variables is required to establish reliable cut-offs for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (AD). Plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181, t-Tau, NfL, GFAP), ApoE genotype, and demographic variables were obtained from a retrospective clinical cohort of cognitive disorders (n = 478). These patients were diagnosed as AD (n = 254) or non-AD (n = 224) according to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42/Aβ40 levels. An analysis using a Ridge logistic regression model was performed to predict the occurrence of AD. The predictive performance of the model was assessed using the observations from a training set (70% of the sample) and validated using a test set (30% of the sample) in each group. Optimum cutoffs for the model were evaluated. The model including plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181, GFAP, ApoE genotype and age was optimal for predicting CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 positivity (AUC .91, sensitivity .86, specificity .82). The model including only plasma biomarkers (Aβ42/Aβ40, p-Tau181, GFAP) provided reliable results (AUC .88, sensitivity .83, specificity .78). Also, GFAP, individually, showed the best performance in discriminating between AD and non-AD groups (AUC .859). The established cut-offs in a three-range strategy performed satisfactorily for the validated predictive model (probability) and individual plasma GFAP (concentration). The plasma GFAP levels and the validated predictive model based on plasma biomarkers represent a relevant step toward the development of a potential clinical approach for AD diagnosis, which should be assessed in further research.",0
40119478,Rare damaging CCR2 variants are associated with lower lifetime cardiovascular risk.,"Previous work has shown a role of CCL2, a key chemokine governing monocyte trafficking, in atherosclerosis. However, it remains unknown whether targeting CCR2, the cognate receptor of CCL2, provides protection against human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Computationally predicted damaging or loss-of-function (REVEL > 0.5) variants within CCR2 were detected in whole-exome-sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants and tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints in gene-burden tests. Given the key role of CCR2 in monocyte mobilization, variants associated with lower monocyte count were prioritized for experimental validation. The response to CCL2 of human cells transfected with these variants was tested in migration and cAMP assays. Validated damaging variants were tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints, atherosclerosis burden, and vascular risk factors. Significant associations were replicated in six independent datasets (n = 1,062,595). Carriers of 45 predicted damaging or loss-of-function CCR2 variants (n = 787 individuals) were at lower risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. One of these variants (M249K, n = 585, 0.15% of European ancestry individuals) was associated with lower monocyte count and with both decreased downstream signaling and chemoattraction in response to CCL2. While M249K showed no association with conventional vascular risk factors, it was consistently associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.81, p = 6.1 × 10 Carriers of an experimentally confirmed damaging CCR2 variant are at a lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease without carrying a higher risk of infections. Our findings provide genetic support for the translational potential of CCR2-targeting as an atheroprotective approach.",0
40119303,The prevalence of sexual dysfunction and its contributors among the women with multiple sclerosis.,"Sexual dysfunction is one of the main complaints in women with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and it affects different aspects of their lives. We aimed to determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among MS patients and address the main contributing factors. This cross-sectional study was performed on 100 women with MS who were referred to Bu-Ali Sina Hospital in 2020-2021. We completed a 19-item Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire for each participant. We also collected demographic data. Patients were categorized based on their disability index Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) by a neurology specialist. Data were analyzed using SPSS 25 software. A significance level of less than 0.05 was considered. The mean age of study participants was 37.4 ± 7.8 years. We observed a negative significant correlation between EDSS and FSFI score (r=-0.371, P-value = 0.001). The correlation between FSFI score and age (r= -0.371, P-value = 0.001), parity (r= -0.322, P-value = 0.001), and disease duration (r= -0.371, P-value < 0.001) was also statistically significant. The mean of FSFI in the patients with university graduation was 25.0 ± 5.3, while it was 22.2 ± 6.4 and 20.1 ± 8.0 in diploma and less than diploma groups, respectively (P-value < 0.05). In linear regression, age, parity, length of disease and education level (just less than diploma and university graduated) as independent variables had a significant relationship with FSFI score (P < 0.05). The prevalence of sexual dysfunction among Iranian women who were suffering from MS was pretty high. Older age groups, less educated, and more disabled patients were addressed as more at-risk groups of impaired sexual function.",0
40119188,ESM-Q: A consensus-based quality assessment tool for experience sampling method items.,"The experience sampling method (ESM) is increasingly used by researchers from various disciplines to answer novel questions about individuals' daily lives. Measurement best practices have long been overlooked in ESM research, and recent reviews show that item quality is often not reported in ESM studies. The absence of information about item quality may be partly explained by the lack of consensus on how ESM item quality should be evaluated. As part of the ESM Item Repository project (esmitemrepository.com)-an international open science initiative that collects ESM items in an open item bank and evaluates their quality-we brought together 42 international ESM experts to develop an ESM item quality assessment tool. In four Delphi phases, experts suggested 57 item quality criteria, rated the criteria, provided arguments for and against the criteria, and rated the criteria again, considering reflections from other experts. The result of the Delphi process is ESM-Q: a quality assessment tool consisting of 10 core criteria, as well as an additional 15 supplementary criteria, to be used depending on the type of items being rated and the availability of supplementary information. The criteria cover topics ranging from construct validity to the optimal wording of items. ESM-Q can aid ESM researchers in selecting existing ESM items, developing new high-quality ESM items, and evaluating the quality of ESM items in systematic reviews. Expert reflections also highlight open research questions surrounding ESM item design that form a research agenda for ESM measurement.",0

40119098,Klotho antiaging protein: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential in diseases.,"Klotho, initially introduced as an anti-aging protein, is expressed in the brain, pancreas, and most prominently in the kidney. The two forms of Klotho (membrane-bound and soluble form) have diverse pharmacological functions such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-fibrotic, tumour-suppressive etc. The membrane-bound form plays a pivotal role in maintaining kidney homeostasis by regulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23) signalling, vitamin D metabolism and phosphate balance. Klotho deficiency has been linked with significantly reduced protection against various kidney pathological phenotypes, including diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is a major cause of chronic kidney disease leading to end-stage kidney disease. Owing to the pleiotropic actions of klotho, it has shown beneficial effects in DKD by tackling the complex pathophysiology and reducing kidney inflammation, oxidative stress, as well as fibrosis. Moreover, the protective effect of klotho extends beyond DKD in other pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, alzheimer's disease, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease. Therefore, this review summarizes the relationship between Klotho expression and various diseases with a special emphasis on DKD, the distinct mechanisms and the potential of exogenous Klotho supplementation as a therapeutic strategy. Future research into exogenous Klotho could unravel novel treatment avenues for DKD and other diseases.",0
40118996,H105A peptide eye drops promote photoreceptor survival in murine and human models of retinal degeneration.,"Photoreceptor death leads to inherited blinding retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). As disease progression often outpaces therapeutic advances, developing effective treatments is urgent. This study evaluates the efficacy of small peptides derived from pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), which are known to restrict common cell death pathways associated with retinal diseases. We tested chemically synthesized peptides (17-mer and H105A) with affinity for the PEDF receptor, PEDF-R, delivered as eye drops to two RP mouse models: rd10 (phosphodiesterase 6b mutation) and Rho Here we show that peptides 17-mer and H105A delivered via eye drops successfully reach the retina, promote photoreceptor survival, and improve retinal function in both RP mouse models. Intravitreal delivery of a AAV-H105A vector delays photoreceptor degeneration in Rho PEDF peptide-based eye drops offer a promising, minimally invasive therapy to prevent photoreceptor degeneration in retinal disorders, with a favorable safety profile. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a rare inherited condition that causes the gradual death of photoreceptors (light-sensing cells) in the eye, leading to vision loss. There is currently no cure. This study tested a potential treatment using small protein fragments (peptides) from PEDF, a protective protein naturally found in the eye. Researchers delivered these peptides through eye drops or gene therapy in mouse models of RP and to human retinal organoids (lab-grown retina tissue). Mice treated early maintained healthy vision cells, while untreated mice experienced rapid cell loss and vision decline. These results suggest that peptide-based eye drops could be a simple, safe, and effective way to slow vision loss in patients with RP.",0

In this study, a cytometric bead array (CBA) method for measuring the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) was evaluated. Fifty patients with cognitive impairment (CI) and 22 cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls were recruited. CI patients were classified into Aβ + and Aβ - groups according to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan results. Biomarker levels in the plasma of all participants and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 28 CI patients were measured via CBA. Plasma P-tau181 levels were greatest in the Aβ + CI group and showed excellent performance in differentiating Aβ + CI patients from CU controls. The plasma and CSF levels of P-tau181 were correlated with each other and had similar diagnostic performance for distinguishing between Aβ + CI patients and Aβ- CI patients. Overall, CBA is a potential cost-effective method for measuring plasma biomarkers, particularly P-tau181, in AD patients.",0
40118863,ANXA11 biomolecular condensates facilitate protein-lipid phase coupling on lysosomal membranes.,"Phase transitions of cellular proteins and lipids play a key role in governing the organisation and coordination of intracellular biology. Recent work has raised the intriguing prospect that phase transitions in proteins and lipids can be co-regulated. Here we investigate this possibility in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granule-ANXA11-lysosome ensemble, where ANXA11 tethers RNP granules to lysosomal membranes to enable their co-trafficking. We show that changes to the protein phase state within this system, driven by the low complexity ANXA11 N-terminus, induces a coupled phase state change in the lipids of the underlying membrane. We identify the ANXA11 interacting proteins ALG2 and CALC as potent regulators of ANXA11-based phase coupling and demonstrate their influence on the nanomechanical properties of the ANXA11-lysosome ensemble and its capacity to engage RNP granules. The phenomenon of protein-lipid phase coupling we observe within this system serves as a potential regulatory mechanism in RNA trafficking and offers an important template to understand other examples across the cell whereby biomolecular condensates closely juxtapose organellar membranes.",0

To improve the likelihood of success of such therapies, Roche Brainshuttle technology utilizes a single anti-transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)-antigen-binding antibody fragment linked to a therapeutic antibody, allowing engagement with TfR1 to transport the therapeutic antibody into the brain via receptor-mediated transcytosis. We compared Fc-silenced and Fc-competent variants of the Brainshuttle and the parental (non-shuttled) type II CD20 mAb, obinutuzumab in in vitro and in vivo (mouse and cynomolgus macaque) models. Endpoints assessed included B cell binding, B cell killing, tolerability, and ability to cross the BBB. The Fc-silenced Brainshuttle construct showed a superior safety profile compared with the Fc-competent construct while maintaining the ability to cross the BBB and to deplete B cells in head-to-head comparisons in human and mouse in vitro and in mouse and cynomolgus macaque in vivo models. Together, our data provide a path forward for the future development of safe and efficacious brain-targeted B-cell-depleting therapies.

40118731,Sample size estimates for biomarker-based outcome measures in clinical trials in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer disease (AD)-modifying therapies are approved for treatment of early-symptomatic AD. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) provides a unique opportunity to test therapies in presymptomatic individuals. Using data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), sample sizes for clinical trials were estimated for various cognitive, imaging, and CSF outcomes. Sample sizes were computed for detecting a reduction of either absolute levels of AD-related pathology (amyloid, tau) or change over time in neurodegeneration (atrophy, hypometabolism, cognitive change). Biomarkers measuring amyloid and tau pathology had required sample sizes below 200 participants per arm (examples CSF Aβ42/40: 47[95 %CI 25,104], cortical PIB 49[28,99], CSF p-tau181 74[48,125]) for a four-year trial in presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0) to have 80 % power (5 % statistical significance) to detect a 25 % reduction in absolute levels of pathology, allowing 40 % dropout. For cognitive, MRI, and FDG, it was more appropriate to detect a 50 % reduction in rate of change. Sample sizes ranged from 250 to 900 (examples hippocampal volume: 338[131,2096], cognitive composite: 326[157,1074]). MRI, FDG and cognitive outcomes had lower sample sizes when including indivduals with mild impairment (CDR=0.5 and 1) as well as presymptomatic individuals (CDR=0). Despite the rarity of ADAD, presymptomatic clinical trials with feasible sample sizes given the number of cases appear possible.",0
40118730,Sleep health profiles across six population-based cohorts and recommendations for validating clustering models.,"Model-based clustering is increasingly used to identify multidimensional sleep health profiles. However, generalizability is rarely assessed because of complexities of data sharing and harmonization. Our goal was to evaluate the generalizability of multidimensional sleep health profiles across older adult populations in Western countries and assess whether they predict depressive symptoms over time. We harmonized five self-reported sleep health indicators (satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration) across six population-based cohorts from the United States and Netherlands (N=614 - 3209 each) and performed identical latent class analysis in each cohort. Novel multivariable similarity metrics, patterns of sleep health and cluster sizes were used to match clusters and assess generalizability across cohorts. We compared cluster characteristics cross-sectionally and used linear mixed-effects modeling to relate sleep health clusters to depressive symptoms over time. ""Average sleep health"" (moderate duration; high quality/efficiency; 42.7%-76.7% of sample) and ""poor sleep health"" (short duration; low quality/efficiency; high daytime sleepiness; 9.4%-20.4% of sample) clusters were generalizable across cohorts. In four cohorts ""inefficient sleep"" clusters were identified and in two cohorts ""long, efficient sleep"" clusters were identified. At 3years, those in the poor sleep cluster had depression symptoms that were 1.40-2.79 times greater than in the average sleep cluster, across all cohorts. We identified two profiles - average sleep health and poor sleep health - that were generalizable across six samples of older adults and predicted depressive symptoms, underscoring the importance of the sleep health paradigm.",0
40118715,Maximizing the benefit and managing the risk of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapy for Alzheimer's disease: Strategies and research directions.,"Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (MABs) have introduced a new era of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics with disease-targeted drugs. Three agents --- aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab --- have been approved and others are in development. These agents are administered intravenously, once in the brain they activate microglia to engulf amyloid-beta protein fibrillar plaques. Each approved agent has a specific profile of administration, titration, amyloid target, and adverse events. In 18 month trials of participants with early AD (defined as mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia), anti-amyloid MABs slow cognitive and functional decline by approximately 30 ​%. Amyloid positron emission tomography reveals marked reductions in amyloid plaque burden; reductions below a threshold of 15-25 Centiloids are associated with clinical benefit. The magnitude, scope, and trajectory of clinical end points provide the basis for interpretations of clinical meaningfulness. Occurrence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with intracerebral edema, microhemorrhages, or superficial siderosis must be monitored and managed to prevent serious or rare catastrophic consequences. Infusion reactions occur and anticipatory management is required. Development of subcutaneous formulations and use of blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring promises to increase the accessibility and decrease the demands on health care systems associated with these agents. Anti-amyloid MABs provide the foundation for further advances in developing a repertoire of disease-targeted therapies for AD.",0
40118475,Role of inflammation and haemostasis on aetiology and prognosis in young patients with ischaemic stroke: study protocol of the Observational Dutch Young Symptomatic StrokE study-EXTended (ODYSSEY-nEXT) - a multicentre prospective cohort study.,"The cause of ischaemic stroke at a young age remains unknown in 30% of cases, highlighting the need to identify hidden causes and risk factors in young patients. Transient and chronic risk factors may interact with the inflammatory and haemostatic systems, potentially driving key mechanisms in the pathogenesis. The 'Observational Dutch Young StrokE study-Extended' (ODYSSEY-nEXT) aims to enhance our understanding of these complex interactions through detailed phenotyping of the immune and haemostatic system and explore their relationship with long-term prognosis. The ODYSSEY-nEXT is a multicentre prospective controlled cohort study of patients aged 18-50 years with a first neuroimaging-proven ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and healthy controls. We aim to include a total of 200 patients and 60 controls between January 2023 and January 2027. Blood samples will be collected within 72 hours after the index event and at 3 months to assess inflammatory and haemostatic markers. In a subgroup of 20 patients, whole blood analysis will be performed to investigate ex vivo immune cell functionality, the capacity of platelets to release granules and thrombin generation.

40118459,Visualize neuronal membrane cholesterol with split- fluorescent protein tagged YDQA sensor.,"Cholesterol is a major component of the cellular plasma membrane (PM), and its homeostasis is essential for brain health. Dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in vivo visualization of cholesterol has remained challenging, hindering a comprehensive understanding of AD pathology. In this study, we generated a new sensor combining the split-fluorescent protein tags with YDQA, a derivate of cholesterol-dependent cytolysin PFO. Through a series of validations in cell and C. elegans models, we demonstrate that the new sensor (name as sfPMcho) efficiently detects neuronal PM cholesterol. We further applied this sensor in 5X FAD and APOE KO mice models and revealed the cholesterol changes within neurons. PM cholesterol became sparse and locally aggregated in neuron bodies but significantly accumulated in nerve fibers. Collectively, this study provides a new tool for detecting neuronal PM cholesterol in vivo and uncovers cholesterol abnormalities in AD-related pathology at the cellular level. Further development based on this sensor or the similar strategy are to be expected.",0
40118370,Investigating social cognition in Multiple Sclerosis: Does Implicit Biological Motion processing affect visuo-spatial attention?,"The perception of Biological Motion (BM) is critical for understanding social cues. A limited number of moving light dots resembling a moving individual, can suggest social intention information, providing an attentional orienting. This ability to predict other's intentions from BM cues refers to social cognition, an ability impaired in several neurological diseases. As in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) an impairment in visuo-spatial attention and social cognition has been observed, we aim to investigate the possible differences in the visuo-spatial attention between MS patients and healthy individuals by using BM stimuli as cues. We tested 37 MS patients and 40 healthy controls (HC), who performed a modified central cue Posner task, using BM stimuli as cues that are not always predictive of the target location. They were represented by Point Light Walker (PLW) configuration, a series of dots arranged at the human joints and walking through the left or right of the screen, shown in the global (whole body) or local (two dots, indicating the feet of the PLW) configuration. MS patients exhibited overall slower responses compared to HC. In MS patients, a weaker advantage of valid trial over invalid ones was evident when cue had a local than global BM configuration. Also, MS patients showed a slower performance than HC in valid trials with local BM cues. The difference between groups was attenuated when the cue had a global BM configuration. These findings suggest possible impairment of local BM cue processing in MS patients, possibly due to delays or deficits in interpreting feet motion as biological information, reducing the cue's predictive power.",0
40118333,Donepezil alleviates hepatic steatosis by mitigating ER stress via the AMPK/autophagy pathway.,"Donepezil (Do), a drug known for its ability to reduce neuronal inflammation and for its use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, has shown promise in combating hepatic lipid accumulation in hyperlipidemic conditions and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a factor associated with alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which these problems are alleviated have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effects of Do on hepatic lipid metabolism through both in vitro and in vivo studies. We examined the expression of proteins associated with lipogenesis and ER stress via immunoblot analysis, and hepatic lipid accumulation was assessed via oil red O staining. In addition, autophagosome formation was analyzed by counting MDC-positive cells. Our results demonstrated that Do treatment improved hepatic lipid metabolism and reduced the expression of ER stress markers, resulting in decreased lipogenic lipid deposition and apoptosis in the hepatocytes and livers of hyperlipidemic mice. Mechanistically, knocking down AMPK or inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3 MA) attenuated the effects of Do on palmitate-exposed hepatocytes. These results suggest that Do alleviates hepatic ER stress via the AMPK/autophagy pathway and AMPK-mediated fatty acid oxidation, resulting in improved hepatic lipid metabolism and reduced hepatic steatosis and apoptosis. Our study provides evidence that Do may be a promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).",0
40118234,Parsimonious EBM: generalising the event-based model of disease progression for simultaneous events.,"The event-based model of disease progression (EBM) infers a temporal ordering of biomarker abnormalities, defining different disease stages, from short-term data. A key modelling choice of the EBM is that biomarker abnormalities, termed events, are serially ordered. This enforces a strict equality between the number of input biomarkers and the number of model stages, limiting its ability to infer simple staging systems and latent disease processes. To overcome this, we introduce the parsimonious event-based model of disease progression (P-EBM). The P-EBM generalises the EBM to allow multiple new biomarker abnormalities, termed ""simultaneous events"", at each model stage. We evaluate the P-EBM performance in simulated data to show it accurately estimates orderings with arbitrary event arrangements under realistic experimental conditions. When applied to sporadic AD data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the P-EBM estimated a sequence with 7 model stages from a dataset of 12 biomarkers that more closely fitted the data than the EBM. The sets of simultaneous events, such as decreased cerebrospinal fluid total tau and p-tau",0
40118165,Cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases: A trans-diagnostic approach using a lesion-symptom mapping analysis.,"Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), reflect a spectrum of cognitive impairments unified by cognitive decline. Traditional diagnostic approaches often overlook shared landscapes of these disorders. A transdiagnostic approach, cutting across conventional boundaries, may improve understanding of shared mechanisms. This study uses lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) to identify critical brain structures responsible for cognitive impairments. Patients diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), probable AD, and probable bvFTD were recruited from our memory clinic. Diagnoses were made by a multidisciplinary team using established criteria. Participants underwent detailed medical and neurological examinations, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and neuropsychological assessment. MRI scans were processed using FreeSurfer. LSM was used to assess correlations between brain structures and cognitive performance. Significant correlations were found between neuropsychological test scores and reduced volume in specific brain regions. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test was linked to the right hippocampus and left nucleus accumbens. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised correlated with the right hippocampus, left nucleus accumbens, and right middle temporal gyrus. Verbal fluency was linked to the left superior temporal sulcus and left middle temporal gyrus. Digit Span forward correlated with left superior frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal region, while Digit Span backward was linked to the right precuneus. Digit-Symbol Coding was associated with the left inferior parietal region. This study highlights common neural targets in MCI, AD, and bvFTD and their link with cognitive impairment, emphasizing the value of LSM within a transdiagnostic approach to neurodegenerative diseases.",0
40118053,Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identification of biomarkers for amyloid and tau PET stages.,"Accurate staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts. These results underscore the potential of proteomic-based signatures to refine AD diagnostic criteria and improve patient stratification in clinical trials.",0
40117986,"The impact of extreme high temperatures on ADRD hospitalization in Guangdong, China, 2017-2019.","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) have emerged as a major global health challenge due to the aging population. This study is among the first to investigate the impact of extreme high temperatures on ADRD hospitalization in a developing country, leveraging individual-level inpatient medical records. We found that both transient and cumulative exposure to heat waves significantly increased total hospitalization expenses and the length of hospital stay for ADRD patients. Specifically, an additional day with a daily mean temperature exceeding 30 °C in the preceding 7 days, compared to a moderate day with a temperature between 14-18 °C, was associated with a 1.5 % (200.2 yuan) increase in total hospitalization expenses and a 1.8 % (0.2 days) increase in the length of hospital stay. These effects were largely driven by out-of-pocket expenditures on nursing care and were particularly pronounced among male patients and those aged over 75.",0
40117985,Validation of the Patient-Determined Disease Steps in ambulatory older adults with multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is increasingly prevalent among older adults, and this results in the cumulative effects of aging and MS on mobility disability. The Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) is a patient-reported outcome measure of mobility disability in adults with MS, but its validity has not been established in older adults. This study validated the PDDS in older adults with MS by examining correlations with conceptually-relevant objective and subjective measures, including neuroimaging markers. The sample included older adults with MS (N = 87, mean age = 64.67 ± 4.24yrs, percent female = 65.5). Primary outcome measures for validation included the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), University of Alabama at Birmingham Life-Space-Assessment scale (UAB-LSA), Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), oral Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (Oral SDMT), and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Structural measures of brain integrity, evaluated via 3T MRI, included grey matter volumes (thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus), and total white matter lesion load (WMLL). Spearman correlations were used for analyses based on non-normality of the data. Higher PDDS scores were significantly correlated with slower walking speed (T25FW time: ρ= 0.664, p < .001), worse lower extremity functioning (SPPB: ρ= -0.540, p < .001), poor fine motor dexterity (9HPT time) bilaterally (dominant hand: ρ= 0.367, p < .001; non-dominant hand: ρ= 0.263, p= .014), worse fatigue (FSS: ρ= 0.383, p < .001), and lower community mobility (UAB-LSA: ρ= -0.586, p < .001). Higher PDDS scores were also associated with lower grey matter volume in the caudate (ρ= -0.218, p= .042), putamen (ρ= -0.226, p= .036), and hippocampus (ρ= -0.213, p= .047). There were no significant correlations with WMLL, Oral SDMT, or socio-demographic covariates. The PDDS is a valid self-report measure of MS-related disability in ambulatory older adults with MS.",0
40117973,Delving into the crucial role of the initial structure in the dynamic and self-assembly of amyloid beta.,"Alzheimer's disease involves the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) monomers that form oligomers and fibrils in the brain. Studying the Aβ monomer is critical for understanding Aβ assembly and peptide behavior and has implications for drug design. Choosing a starting structure with a higher aggregation tendency for cost-effective MD studies and drug design is crucial. Previous studies have utilized distinct initial conformations, leading to varying results. Hence, this study was conducted to compare different initial conformations using the same MD simulation protocol to investigate the behavior and oligomerization propensity of different starting structures of Aβ during 1μs. The behavior of the monomers and their self-assembly systems were studied thoroughly, and the results revealed that highly helical Aβ monomers which used as starting structures retain high helix content during the simulation, and their tautomerization states did not cause significant changes in the structure. On the other hand, the Aβ extended and S-shaped monomers displayed the fingerprints of the fibril structure, which is believed to be more favorable for self-assembly. Self-assembly behaviors were seen for three S-shaped and three Aβ extended peptides. However, both conformations did not show stable β-sheet intermolecular interaction. For the Aβ16-22 monomer as a fragment of the Aβ that can assemble into fibrils, the impacts of capping and uncapping on the initial structure were also investigated. The results displayed that capped and uncapped structures can form oligomers with β-sheet at termini. However, in the capped state, β-sheet interactions were more stable and remained relatively longer than uncapped.",0
40117898,Differentiating Pathology of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis From Multiple Sclerosis in Children Using Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Biomarkers.,"To investigate the pathologic differences in patients with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI). Fifteen children with POMS and eight children with ADEM underwent DTI and DBSI. The comparison of DTI and DBSI diffusivity measures of POMS (31 scans) and ADEM (17 scans) was performed as group comparison and association over time. In univariate analysis of average measures of DBSI and DTI over time, DBSI fractional anisotropy is lower in POMS than ADEM (P = 0.002), indicative of axonal injury of POMS. Higher DBSI fiber fraction (P = 0.046) and DBSI radial diffusivity (P = 0.016) but lower DBSI nonrestricted fraction (P = 0.005) in patients with POMS suggests higher axonal density, demyelination, and lower extra-axonal edema in POMS. However, there are no significant differences in DTI measures between POMS and ADEM over time. DBSI may be useful to monitor and quantitatively compare coexisting axonal injury, demyelination, and inflammation in central nervous system white matter tracts in children with POMS and ADEM, overcoming the disadvantages of DTI. Larger prospective longitudinal studies are required to confirm these results.",0
40117490,Reengineering of Circularly Permuted Caspase-2 to Enhance Enzyme Stability and Enable Crystallographic Studies.,"Caspase activation has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory conditions, generating interest in targeting this family of proteases for drug development. Caspase-2 (Casp2) in particular has been implicated in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by cleaving tau protein into fragment Δtau314, which reversibly impairs cognitive and synaptic function. Thus, Casp2 inhibition could be a useful strategy for therapeutic treatment of AD. To that end, we have previously synthesized and characterized various series of peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors that demonstrate potency and selectivity for Casp2 over caspase-3 (Casp3). Despite promising developments in the design of selective Casp2 inhibitors, low expression yields of Casp2 hinder crystallographic experiments and make structure-based design challenging. The design of circularly permuted (cp) Casp2 increased protein yields considerably; however, this protein could not be crystallized. This article describes the characterization of ten novel cpCasp2 mutants, designed with the goal of increasing stability and facilitating crystallization. Gratifyingly, engineered mutant JF1cpCasp2 displayed high relative stability and was readily crystallizable with the canonical Casp2 inhibitor AcVDVAD-CHO, leading to what we believe to be the first crystal structures of any reverse caspase in the PDB. Moreover, we have reported the structure of JF1cpCasp2 with our recently described Casp2-selective inhibitor MUR-65, which revealed a unique interaction with Arg417 in the binding pocket. Overall, JF1cpCasp2 has proven valuable for structure-based design and expanding understanding of Casp2 inhibition, with potential implications for drug discovery and the development of more selective compounds.",0

40117242,Exploration of small molecules as inhibitors of potential BACE1 protein to treat amyloid cerebrovascular disease by employing molecular modeling and simulation approaches.,"Amyloid cerebrovascular disease, primarily driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, is intricately linked to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) plays a critical role in the production of Aβ, making it a key therapeutic target. In the current work, a CNS library of ChemDiv database containing 44085 compounds was screened against the BACE1 protein. Initially, a structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis was constructed, followed by virtual screening, with the screened hits docked to the BACE1 protein to determine the optimal binding modes. The docking results were examined using the glide gscore and chemical interactions of the docked molecules. The cutoff value of -5 kcal/mol was used to select hits with high binding affinities. A total of seven hits were chosen based on the glide g score. Furthermore, the possible binding mechanisms of the docked ligands were investigated, and it was discovered that all seven selected ligands occupied the same site in the predicted binding pocket of protein. The bioactivity scores of the compounds demonstrated that the chosen compounds possess the features of lead compounds. The toxicity risks and ADMET features of the selected hits were anticipated, and four compounds, J032-0080, SC13-0774, V030-0915, and V006-5608 were chosen for stability analysis. The selected hits were extremely stable and strongly bound to the BACE1 pocket, and conformational changes caused by RMSD, RMSF, and protein-ligand interactions were assessed using MD modeling. Similarly, principal component analysis revealed a large static number of hydrogen bonds. The MM/GBSA binding free energies maps revealed a significant energy contribution in the binding of selected hits to BACE1. The binding free energy landscapes indicated that the hits were bound with a high binding affinity. Thus, the hits could serve as lead compounds in biophysical investigations to limit the biological activity of the BACE1 protein.",0
40117152,MSAFF: Multi-Way Soft Attention Fusion Framework With the Large Foundation Models for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Complementary information in multi-omics data are crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, existing studies face challenges in addressing the high-level noise and heterogeneity in multi-omics data. This article presents a novel approach that combines large foundation models (LFMs) with soft attention mechanisms to enhance, select, and fuse multi-omics features, thereby improving the performance of disease classification. Specifically, we first propose a mathematical model based on soft attention mechanisms. This model employs multi-head attention (MHA) and self-attention (SA) for feature selection, and uses cross-attention (CA) for feature fusion. Then, a multi-way soft attention fusion framework (MSAFF) with LFMs is proposed. In this approach, biomedical LFMs are used to construct low-noise biomedical features. The multi-way soft attention algorithm implements effective feature selection and fusion described in the mathematical model. Experimental results on the public imaging genetics datasets demonstrate the advanced performances of MSAFF in both disease classification and AD-related pathogeny discrimination. This article provides intelligent support for the diagnosis and pathogenesis research of AD. Our code can be accessed at github.com/fmri123456/MSAFF.",0
40117046,Pea Peptide Modulates Abnormal Aβ Production in PC12 Cells Induced by Lead Exposure.,"Lead (Pb) exposure poses significant health risks, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the neuroprotective effects of pea peptide (PP4) on PC12 cells exposed to Pb. Using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), pretreatment with PP4 at 50 and 200 µM concentrations significantly improved cell viability compared to Pb-only treated cells (P < 0.05), indicating a protective effect. Moreover, Pb exposure led to increased Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) expression at 10 and 20 µM after 24 h (P < 0.05), while β-site amyloid Precursor Protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) levels were elevated across all concentrations tested (P < 0.05). We established that PP4 can mitigate Pb-induced cytotoxicity and reduce the expression of APP and BACE1 by activating the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase / Protein Kinase (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway. This study highlights the potential of PP4 as a therapeutic agent in preventing neurotoxic damage associated with lead exposure, suggesting a novel approach for the management of AD.",0
40117001,"Machine-learning models for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using neuroimaging data: survey, reproducibility, and generalizability evaluation.","Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually made after symptoms such as short-term memory loss are exhibited, which minimizes the intervention and treatment options. The existing screening techniques cannot distinguish between stable MCI (sMCI) cases (i.e., patients who do not convert to AD for at least three years) and progressive MCI (pMCI) cases (i.e., patients who convert to AD in three years or sooner). Delayed diagnosis of AD also disproportionately affects underrepresented and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The significant positive impact of an early diagnosis solution for AD across diverse ethno-racial and demographic groups is well-known and recognized. While advancements in high-throughput technologies have enabled the generation of vast amounts of multimodal clinical, and neuroimaging datasets related to AD, most methods utilizing these data sets for diagnostic purposes have not found their way in clinical settings. To better understand the landscape, we surveyed the major preprocessing, data management, traditional machine-learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques used for diagnosing AD using neuroimaging data such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Once we had a good understanding of the methods available, we conducted a study to assess the reproducibility and generalizability of open-source ML models. Our evaluation shows that existing models show reduced generalizability when different cohorts of the data modality are used while controlling other computational factors. The paper concludes with a discussion of major challenges that plague ML models for AD diagnosis and biomarker discovery.",0

We compared the behavioural and cognitive characteristics of 84 behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 29 left and 14 right-dominant semantic dementia (SDL and SDR) and 49 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients over a follow-up period of 2.4 ± 1.6 years using the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory Revised (CBI-R) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination third edition (ACE-III). Linear mixed modelling of time effects found progression of all CBI-R domains, aside from sleep, beliefs and mood domains, and all ACE-III domains. Modelling of group effects found that bvFTD had greater symptoms than AD in most CBI-R domains. Notably, SDL and SDR compared differently with AD and bvFTD; whilst SDR did not differ significantly from bvFTD in any CBI-R domain, SDL had less severe symptoms than bvFTD in everyday skills, motivation, sleep and eating habits; whilst SDL had greater disturbances in abnormal behaviour and stereotypic behaviour than AD, SDR had greater disturbances in addition in motivation and eating habits. Motivation, eating habits, abnormal behaviour and stereotypic behaviour were the most frequently different behavioural domains between groups. We have shown that the combined, longitudinal use of existing behavioural and cognitive assessments could capture distinct clinical profiles of common and rare dementia syndromes. Our findings also highlight the importance of select behavioural domains such as motivation and the usefulness of separate clinical characterisations of SDL and SDR.",0

The validation process included a 30-min cognitive training session administered twice a week for eight weeks. The feasibility of cognitive function assessments employed the MoCA-K and CoSAS. Additionally, a usability test was performed at the end of the experiment using SUS and the Adapted IMI. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was then employed to compare pre- and post-cognitive function results.ResultsThe feasibility of the implemented cognitive training system based on virtual reality with smart mirror revealed significant differences in the total score, delayed recall, and orientation items of the MoCA-K (p < 0.05). Additionally, a notable improvement was observed in the accuracy and response time of task performance in the CoSAS (p < 0.05).

Currently, research on social functioning in AD across the entire spectrum of the disease is lacking.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to describe the social functioning of persons with AD at each stage of the disease and to investigate how impaired social functioning affects caregiver burden.MethodsCross-sectional data was derived from memory clinics across Germany as part of the pilot study ""Social functioning in individuals with AD and the situation of caregivers"". A total of N = 87 relatives providing care for individuals with mild (n = 20), moderate (n = 40), and severe (n = 23) AD were included. Social functioning of individuals with AD was measured via the caregiver-rated German version of the Social Functioning in Dementia Scale (SF-DEM); caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI-12). Differences between mild, moderate, and severe AD in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and the level of social functioning were examined. A robust linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between social functioning and caregiver burden.ResultsSocial functioning was lower in moderate and severe AD than in mild AD. Higher levels of social functioning were associated with less caregiver burden.ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of integrating social functioning assessments into clinical practice for improving the early detection, diagnosis and interventions for AD. Early interventions to enhance social functioning may diminish caregiver burden.",0
40116688,The effect of anti-seizure medications on Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk and AD-related symptoms: A scoping review.,"BackgroundAs the fastest-growing segment of the population, adults over 65 are at the most significant risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Older adults often use anti-seizure medications (ASMs), which can negatively impact cognitive function, mood, and behavior, mimicking AD or its symptoms. Understanding the effects of ASMs across diverse older adults is crucial, given that some ethnoracial groups are at higher risk for AD or more severe symptoms compared to non-Hispanic Whites.ObjectiveTo summarize the current evidence on the association of ASMs with AD risk and AD-related symptoms and explore the inclusion of ethnoracial minority groups in these studies.MethodsData sources included PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS for English-language studies published between 1990-2024. Selected studies were peer-reviewed, cross-sectional, longitudinal, case-control, and clinical trials on AD dementia or related symptoms and ASMs. Study quality was rated by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Research Medicine.ResultsA total of 27 studies with 1,241,796 participants were included. Data on AD risk from level IB-IIIB evidence studies showed mixed results, with some indicating an increased association with ASM use [OR = 1.05-1.16, 95% CI: 1.01-1.24]. Studies on AD-related symptoms from level IB-IV evidence also showed mixed results. Only three North American studies explicitly included race/ethnicity; most were conducted in European countries.ConclusionsASM use may be modestly associated with an increased risk of AD among the older adult population, but current data are inconclusive.

The TMA-93, a brief binding memory test, has proven useful for diagnosing early AD, and is supported by normative data that accounts for age and cognitive reserve.ObjectiveTo compare the sensitivity of different TMA-93 cutoffs in detecting AD pathology.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on a biobank sample of patients with confirmed AD pathology via amyloid PET or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The sensitivity of six TMA-93 cutoffs was evaluated: the 10th, 15th, and 20th percentiles based on traditional norming (TN) and regression-based norming (RBN). False negatives (FN) characteristics were also analyzed.ResultsA total of 270 AD-positive patients (96 by amyloid-PET, 174 by CSF biomarkers) were included, comprising 224 with mild cognitive impairment and 46 with mild dementia. The 15th percentile using RBN demonstrated substantial sensitivity (80.4%), higher than that of the 10th percentile, and also provided a more uniform distribution across normative groups compared to the TN approach. Higher global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination score) and, in patients over 70, lower cognitive reserve (Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire), were linked to a greater likelihood of FN results.ConclusionsThe 15th percentile cutoff based on RBN, accounting for age and cognitive reserve, improves sensitivity for detecting AD pathology, making it a valuable screening tool for memory complaints. Future normative data from biomarker-negative subjects may enhance the sensitivity of cognitive tests.",0

40116682,V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 as a potential predictor of Alzheimer's disease and advanced aging.,"BackgroundV-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 4 (VSIG4) emerges as a significant player in the immune system pathways. It has been previously identified as a potential hub gene for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging, underscoring its importance in understanding these conditions.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of serum VSIG4 and identify trends in serum VSIG4 in relationship with other biomarkers and neurological tests.MethodsELISA was used to measure the serum concentration of VSIG4 in AD, compared to healthy subjects. The relationship between VSIG4 levels and the age of the subjects, as well as other AD-related serum proteins and various measures of cognition was examined.ResultsVSIG4 was significantly elevated in the serum of AD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0074). Significant correlations were identified between serum VSIG4 and other notable proteins related to AD and inflammation, such as total tau, neurofilament light (NfL), YKL-40, CD14, FABP3, and TNF-α. Significant correlations were also identified between VSIG4 concentration and the results of neurological tests.ConclusionsSerum VSIG4 may reflect neuroinflammation and altered lipid processing, affecting the cognitive performance of AD and aging.",0

40116675,Virtual reality-based interventions for individuals with dementia: A potential further treatment and new perspectives.,"This commentary highlights issues regarding virtual reality (VR)-based interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing their potential to improve cognitive function and delay decline. The aim of this manuscript is to present current findings and critically synthesize the practical applications of VR interventions. A recent meta-analysis demonstrates promising results, with VR interventions enhancing memory, executive functions, and overall cognition. Despite the limited number of studies and small sample sizes, findings suggest that engaging VR environments can motivate patients, fostering adherence to treatment. This commentary underscores the need for further research to validate these results and establish standardized methodologies for the effective use of VR in dementia care. Several methodological aspects and new perspectives are highlighted herein.",0
40116674,Alzheimer-typical temporo-parietal atrophy and hypoperfusion are associated with a more significant cholinergic impairment in amnestic neurodegenerative syndromes.,"BackgroundTo date, cholinomimetics remain central in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, postmortem investigations indicate that the AD-typical progressive amnestic syndrome may also result from predominantly limbic non-AD neuropathology such as TDP-43 proteinopathy and argyrophilic grain disease. Experimental evidence links a beneficial response to cholinomimetics in early AD to reduced markers of cholinergic neurotransmission. However, the cholinergic impairment varies among patients with a clinical AD presentation, likely due to non-AD (co)-pathologies.ObjectiveThis study examines whether AD-typical atrophy and hypoperfusion can provide information about the cholinergic system in clinically diagnosed AD.MethodsThirty-two patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with the tracer N-methyl-4-piperidyl-acetate (MP4A) to estimate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, neurological examinations, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessment. The 'cholinergic deficit' was computed as the deviation of AChE activity from cognitively normal controls across the cerebral cortex and correlated gray matter (GM) and perfusion of temporo-parietal cortices typically affected by AD and basal forebrain (BF) GM.ResultsTemporo-parietal perfusion and GM, as well as the inferior temporal to medial temporal ratio of perfusion correlated negatively with the 'cholinergic deficit'. A smaller Ch4p area of the BF was associated with a more significant 'cholinergic deficit', albeit to a lesser degree than cortical measures.ConclusionsIn clinically diagnosed AD, temporo-parietal GM and perfusion are more closely associated with the 'cholinergic deficit' than BF volumes, making them possible markers for cholinergic treatment response in amnestic neurodegeneration.",0

40116653,"Associations among diurnal cortisol, melatonin, and agitation in people living with cognitive impairment.","BackgroundWhile the underlying mechanisms of agitation are not fully understood in people with Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, research suggests that dysregulated neuroendocrine processes, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, may play a role.ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the associations between salivary cortisol, melatonin at baseline, and agitation both at baseline and at post-intervention.MethodsThis study was a secondary analysis of a two-group, randomized, parallel designed clinical trial of 210 people living with cognitive impairment. Agitation, salivary cortisol, and salivary melatonin were measured at baseline and four weeks. Salivary cortisol and melatonin indicators were generated through three timepoints of cortisol and melatonin collection across the two consecutive days. Presence of agitation was measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Logistic regressions were conducted to achieve the aim.ResultsA significant association was found at baseline between diurnal cortisol slope and agitation (OR = 0.03,",0
